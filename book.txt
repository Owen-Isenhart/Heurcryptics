_Advertisement._


The Author’s intention, when he first began to digest his materials,
was only to exhibit an account of the epidemic diseases at _Aleppo_,
particularly of the plague, which raged three years in that city during
his residence therein. A long and extensive practice among all ranks and
degrees of people, had furnished him with the means of being perfectly
well acquainted with the customs and manners of the inhabitants. The
neighbourhood of this place, its site, and natural productions, he found
had not been so fully described, but that there still was room left
for improvement. Instead, therefore, of confining himself singly to so
much of the general history of the place as might be sufficient for the
purpose of his profession, he has entered into the subject more at large,
and has endeavoured to present the reader with a succinct, but at the
same time an exact account of such things relative thereto as seemed most
to merit attention. It must however be remembered that his observations
are confined to one city, and its environs only. Other places, and those
too at no great distance, may have other customs; and to this it may be
ascribed, that different writers on the head of the customs of eastern
nations present us with very different accounts.

When it is considered that the Author resided many years abroad, and
conversed daily in other languages more than in his own, which he had but
little leisure to cultivate, the defects in his stile, it is hoped, will
be forgiven.

In the plates he has not only endeavoured to give an idea of the various
dresses of the people, but a view of their furniture, habitations, and
amusements.

The birds and fishes here delineated are such as, to the best of the
Author’s knowledge, have not before been properly represented, and those
of the plants are chiefly of the same kind. So many of the _Arabic_ names
of these as were collected, would have been given, had it been possible
to have expressed them justly in _English_ characters, or easy to have
had them correctly printed in _Arabic_; in which language, it must be
observed, all the names of places, _&c._ in this work are given, unless
mentioned to be otherwise.

The different subjects in the first part were intended to have been
pointed out, by varying the running-title according to the subject; but,
by mistake, this was omitted till too late.

The method used by the _Europeans_ for their preservation during the rage
of a pestilence was chiefly intended for the use of the Author’s friends
in _Aleppo_, to whom it was presented on his leaving that country. To
those in _Europe_ he sincerely wishes that it may never otherwise be
useful than to satisfy their curiosity.

How far the Author’s abilities have been equal to the task he has
undertaken, the public will judge; and he intreats their candour.
That he has had fair opportunities of observing, that he has given a
faithful narrative of facts, and that he has used no false colouring
in his representation, he presumes to appeal to his cotemporaries and
acquaintance, who, in visiting these places again in his description, may
perhaps call to mind many agreeable hours they have spent even in these
scenes, so far distant from their native country.




A DESCRIPTION OF THE CITY of ALEPPO, AND THE PARTS ADJACENT.




PART I.


_Haleb_, or, as we call it, _Aleppo_, the present metropolis of
_Syria_[1], though greatly inferior to the cities of _Constantinople_
and _Cairo_ in extent, number of inhabitants, riches, and perhaps several
other circumstances, yet, in respect to buildings, yields to none in the
_Turkish_ empire.

This city and suburbs stand on eight small hills or eminences, none of
them considerable, except that in the middle of the place, on which the
castle is erected. This mount is of a conic form, and seems, in a great
measure, to be artificial, and raised with the earth thrown up out of a
broad deep ditch that surrounds it. The suburbs, called _Sheih il Arab_,
to the N. N. E. are next in height to this, and those to the W. S. W. are
much lower than the parts adjacent, and than any other parts of the city.

An old wall not a little decayed, and a broad ditch now in most places
turned into gardens, surround the city, the circumference of which is
about three miles and an half; but, including the suburbs, which are
chiefly to the North East, the whole may be about seven miles[2].

The houses, are composed of apartments, on each of the sides, of a square
court all of stone, and consist of a ground floor which is generally
arched, and an upper story which is flat on the top, and either terraced
with hard plaister, or paved with stone. Their ceilings are of wood
neatly painted, and sometimes gilded, as are also the window-shutters,
the pannels of some of their rooms, and the cupboard doors, of which
they have a great number: these, taken together, have a very agreeable
effect. Over the doors and windows within the houses of the _Turks_,
are inscribed passages out of the Koran, or verses either of their own
composition, or taken from some of their most celebrated poets. The
_Christians_ generally borrow theirs from scripture.

In all their houses the court yard is neatly paved, and, for the most
part, has a bason with a jet d’eau in the middle, on one or both sides
of which, a small spot is left unpaved for a sort of garden, which often
does not exceed a yard or two square; the verdure, however, which is
here produced, together with the addition of a few flowers in pots, and
the fountains playing, would be a very agreeable sight to the passenger,
if there were openings to the street through which these might be
discovered, but they are entirely shut up with double doors so contrived,
as that, when open, one cannot look into the court yard; and there are no
windows to the street, except a very few in their upper rooms; so that
nothing is to be seen but dead walls, which make their streets appear
very disagreeable to _Europeans_.

Most of the better sort of houses have an arched alcove within this
court open to the north, and opposite to the fountain; the pavement of
this alcove is raised about a foot and an half above that of the yard,
to serve for a divan[3]. Between this and the fountain the pavement is
generally laid out in mosaic work, with various coloured marble; as is
also the floor of a large hall with a cupola roof, which commonly has a
fountain in the middle, and is almost the only tolerably cool room in
their houses during the summer.

The people of fashion have in the outer court but one or two rooms
below stairs for themselves, the rest are for servants and stabling;
the pavement of this is but rough, as their horses stand there all the
summer, except a few hours in the middle of the day. Above stairs is
a colonade, if not round the whole court, at least fronting the west,
off from which are their rooms and _kiosks_[4]; these latter are a sort
of wooden divans, that project a little way from the other part of the
building, and hang over the street; they are raised about one foot and
an half higher, than the floor of the room, to which they are quite
open, and, by having windows in front and on each side, there is a great
draught of air, which makes them cool in the summer, the advantage
chiefly intended by them. Beyond this court is another, containing the
womens apartments, built much in the same manner that I have described
the other houses; some few of them have a tolerable garden, in which, as
well as in the outer yard, there is generally a tall cypress tree.

The mosques in _Aleppo_ are numerous, and some few of them magnificent;
before each is a square area, in the middle of which, is a fountain for
the appointed ablutions before prayers, and behind some of the larger
mosques there is a little garden.

Besides these open spaces there are many large _khanes_ or (as most
travellers call them) _caravan seraijs_, consisting of a capacious
square, on all sides of which are built on the ground floor a number of
rooms, used occasionally for stables, warehouses, or chambers. Above
stairs a colonade occupies the four sides, to which opens a number
of small rooms, wherein the merchants, as well strangers as natives,
transact most of their business.

The streets are generally narrow, but, however, are well paved, and kept
remarkably clean.

The market places, called here _bazars_, are properly, long, covered,
narrow streets, on each side of which are a number of small shops just
sufficient to hold the tradesman (and perhaps one or two more) with
all the commodities he deals in about him, the buyer being obliged to
stand without. Each separate branch of business has a particular _bazar_
allotted them, and these, as well as the streets, are all locked up an
hour and an half after sunset, and many of them earlier, which is a great
security from house-breakers. It deserves to be remembered, how odd
soever it may appear, that though their doors are mostly cased with iron,
yet their locks are made of wood.

In the suburbs, to the eastward, are their slaughter-houses, in a very
airy place, with a large open field before them. The tanners have a
_khane_, where they work, in the south west part of the town near the
river.

To the southward, just without the walls in the suburbs, they burn lime;
and a little way further is a small village, where they make ropes and
catgut, which last manufacture is, at some seasons, extremely offensive.

In _Mesherka_, which is part of the suburbs on the opposite side of the
river to the westward, is a glass-house, where they make a coarse kind of
white glass, but they work only a few months in the winter, the greatest
part of this manufacture being brought from a village called _Armenass_,
about thirty-five miles to the westward, from whence also they bring the
sand used in their glass-house at _Aleppo_.

The city is supplied with very good water from some springs near the
banks of the river at _Heylan_, about five miles to the north north
east, which is conveyed from thence by an aquæduct, and distributed to
the different parts of the town by earthen pipes. There is a tradition,
that this aquæduct was the work of the empress _Helena_, and that from
her the springs took their present name: this water is sufficient for
the necessary purposes of drinking, cookery, _&c._ Besides this, almost
every house has a well, but the water of these, being brackish, is only
employed for washing their court yards, and filling the reservoirs for
their fountains.

The fuel, used in their houses, is wood and charcoal; for heating their
bagnios, they burn the dung of animals, leaves of plants, parings of
fruit, and such like, which they employ people to gather and dry for that
purpose.

The markets are well supplied with provisions, of which we shall have
occasion to give a more particular account.

For at least four or five miles round _Aleppo_, the ground is very stony
and uneven, having a number of small eminences, most of which are as
high as any part of the city. From the west south west to the north west
by west, this sort of country continues for at least twenty miles, with
a number of small fertile plains interspersed. To the northward and
southward, after about six or seven miles, the country is level and not
stony. To the eastward a vast plain commences, which, though it is called
the _desart_, yet for a great many miles beyond _Aleppo_, affords a fine
fertile soil.

In clear weather, the top of mount _Cassius_, bearing west by south,
and part of the mountains, called _Amanus_, are to be seen from several
places in the city; but, as the nearest of these, _viz._ that part of
_Amanus_, which stretches to the eastward and approaches to _Killis_,
is at least thirty miles distant from _Aleppo_, they can be supposed to
have but very little influence upon the air of the place, any more than a
small conical rocky hill, called _Sheih Barakat_, at about twenty miles
to the west by north, and a narrow chain of low rocky hills, usually
named the _Black Mountains_, to the south south east, at about ten miles
distance.

The river _Coic_[5] (if a stream scarce six or eight yards wide deserves
that name) passes along the western part of the city within a few yards
of the walls, and barely serves to water a narrow slip of gardens upon
its banks, reaching from about five miles north to about three miles
south of the town. Besides these gardens, there are a few more near a
village called _Bab Allah_, about two miles to the north-east, which are
supplied by the aquæduct.

The rising-grounds above the gardens, to which the water cannot be
conveyed, are in some places laid out in vineyards interspersed with
olive, fig, and pistachio trees, as are also many spots to the eastward,
where there are no gardens.

Inconsiderable as this stream and these gardens may appear, yet they
contain almost the only water and trees that are to be met with for
twenty or thirty miles round, for the villages are all destitute of
trees, and most of them only supplied with water by what rain they can
save in cisterns.

The latitude of _Aleppo_, as fixed by a _French_ mathematician who was
there in the year 1753, is thirty-six degrees twelve minutes N. latitude,
which, though some minutes different from the observations of others,
yet is probably the most exact, as he was not only a man of eminence in
his profession, but was also furnished with the best instruments, an
advantage which perhaps the other observators had not. The longitude is
said to be 37 D. 40 M. east from _London_. Its distance from the sea,
in a direct line is about sixty miles, and its height from thence is
considerable, but not yet accurately ascertained.

Having thus finished what was thought necessary concerning the situation
of _Aleppo_, with respect to the parts adjacent, let us now take a
general view of the face of the country throughout _Syria_.

The coast in general is bordered by very high mountains, except near
_Seleucia_, and there from mount _Pieria_ to mount _Cassius_, which is
ten or fifteen miles, is quite level, leaving a passage for the river
_Orontes_ to empty itself into the _Mediterranean_. Those mountains are
covered with trees, shrubs, and a number of plants; so that, different
from the plains, they retain their verdure all the summer. As they abound
with springs these collect into little rivulets, and in a few places on
that side next the sea rivers, which plentifully irrigate the plains
that are between them and the sea. Behind them, on the land side, are
generally extensive plains which receive great benefit from the streams
that descend from the mountains, nigh to which they are well cloathed
with myrtle, oleander, and other shrubs. The opposite boundaries of
those plains are for the most part low, barren, rocky hills, and behind
them other large plains, which though they have no water but the rain
which falls in the winter, yet are exceeding fertile; and this is not
improbably occasioned by the quantity of soil which must necessarily be
washed down into them from the surrounding little rocky hills, by the
violent rains of the winter. This intermixture of rocky eminencies and
plains reaches within land about sixty or seventy miles, after which the
country is generally level, from what I have been told, all the way to
_Bassorah_, and is properly _Arabia Deserta_.

In all _Syria_ there is but one river, (the _Orontes_) that having
its rise on the land side of the high mountains, finds its way to the
sea; the rest, which indeed are but few and inconsiderable, being soon
absorbed by the thirsty plains through which they run, more especially
as they receive but very few supplies in their passage: and even the
_Orontes_, though it be swelled by a number of little brooks from the
high mountains behind which it runs, and derives a farther supply from
the lake of _Antioch_, yet seems as considerable a great many miles above
_Antioch_, as where it empties itself into the _Mediterranean_.

The seasons in this country, generally speaking, are exceeding regular,
particularly at _Aleppo_, where the air is usually very healthy, and so
pure and free from damps that all the inhabitants, of what rank soever,
sup and sleep in their court-yards, or upon the house tops, exposed to
the open air, from the end of _May_ to the middle of _September_, without
suffering any inconveniency from it. However, as I shall hereafter have
occasion to be more particular on this subject, I will at present only
mention in general the changes of the seasons as they appear to our
senses.

The natives reckon the severity, of the winter to last but forty days,
which they call _Maarbanie_, beginning from the twelfth of _December_,
and ending the twentieth of _January_; and in fact this computation comes
near the truth. The air, during this time, is excessively piercing,
particularly to strangers, even though they are but just come from a cold
climate. In the thirteen years that I resided there, it happened not
above three times that the ice was of sufficient strength to bear a man,
and that too with caution, and only in a situation where the sun-beams
never reached it. The snow, excepting three years, never lay above a day,
and even in the depth of winter, when the sun shines out and there is no
wind, it is warm, nay sometimes almost hot, in the open air. Narcissus’s
are in flower during the whole of this weather, and hyacinths and violets
at the latest appear before it is quite over.

As _February_ advances, the fields which were partly green before, now
by the springing up of the later grain become entirely covered with
an agreeable verdure, and though the trees continue in their leafless
wintery state till the end of this month, or the beginning of _March_,
yet the almond, when latest, being in blossom before the middle of
_February_, and quickly succeeded by the apricot, peach, _&c._ gives
the gardens an agreeable appearance. The spring now becomes extremely
pleasant, and has no defect but its short duration, for as _March_ brings
it on with rapidity, so _April_ advances with like haste towards summer,
and the gay livery that the fields wore in those two months, and indeed
most of the winter, fades before the middle of _May_; and before the end
of this month the whole country puts on so parched and barren an aspect,
that one would scarce think it was capable of producing any thing but
the very few robust plants which still have vigour enough to resist the
extreme heats. From this time not so much as one refreshing shower falls,
and scarce a friendly cloud appears to shelter us from the excessive heat
of the sun till about the middle of _September_, when generally a little
rain falling, either in _Aleppo_, or the neighbourhood, refreshes the air
greatly.

From these first rains till the second, an interval of at least between
twenty and thirty days, the weather is temperate, serene, and extremely
delightful, and if the rains have been at all plentiful, though but of a
few hours duration, the country soon assumes a new face; after the second
rains the weather becomes variable, and winter approaches by degrees, not
with so swift a pace as the summer, for the greater part of the trees
retain their leaves till the middle of _November_; the most delicate
never make fires till about the end of this month, and some few pass the
whole winter without them.

It is seldom that _Aleppo_ is troubled with very hard gales of wind; the
coldest winds in the winter are those that blow from between the north
west and the east, and the nearer they approach to the last-mentioned
point, the colder they are during winter and part of the spring. But
from the beginning of _May_ to the end of _September_, the winds blowing
from the very same points bring with them a degree and kind of heat
which one would imagine came out of an oven, and which, when it blows
hard, will affect metals within the houses, such as locks of room doors,
nearly as much as if they had been exposed to the rays of the sun; yet
it is remarkable that water kept in jars is much cooler at this time
than when a cool westerly wind blows. In this season the only remedy is
to shut all the doors and windows, for though these winds do not kill
as the _sumyel_, (which are much of the same nature) do on the desart,
yet they are extremely troublesome, causing a languor and difficulty in
respiration to most people. Many summers pass without any of these winds,
and, during my stay, in no summer have there been more than four or five
days of them; for though the easterly and northerly winds reign most
in the winter, yet providence has wisely ordered it that the westerly
winds are the most frequent in the summer, without which, considering
the intense heat of the sun’s rays, and the reflection from a bare rocky
tract of ground, and from the white stone walls of the houses, the
country would scarcely be habitable.

Where the town is situated it is, as most of the other rising grounds,
rocky, and the soil just round it a white light earth, very stoney,
and not fertile; but in most other parts of the country, the soil is a
redish, or sometimes blackish light mold, and produces the fruits of the
earth in great abundance.

A considerable part of the country lies uncultivated, from the tyranny
of their government, the insecurity of property, and the consequent
indolence of the inhabitants; but very little is allowed to lie fallow
with a view to culture, nor do they use much manure.

They begin to plough about the latter end of _September_, and sow their
earliest wheat about the middle of _October_. The frosts are never severe
enough to prevent their ploughing all the winter, so that they continue
to sow all sorts of grain to the end of _January_, and barley sometimes
after the middle of _February_. No harrow is used, but the ground is
ploughed a second time after it is sown, in order to cover the grain; in
some places where the soil is a little sandy they plough but once, and
that is after sowing. The plough is so light, that a man of a moderate
strength may easily carry it with one hand: a little cow, or at most two,
and sometimes only an ass, is sufficient to draw it in ploughing, and one
man both drives and holds it with so much ease that he generally smokes
his pipe at the same time.

Besides _Turkey_ wheat, barley, and cotton[6], they sow in the fields,
cicers[7], lentils[8], beans[9], chickling[10], small vetch[11],
sesamum, ricinus, hemp, a green kidney bean[12], called by the
natives mash, and much eat; musk melon[13] water melon[14], a small
sort of cucumber called ajour, fennel-flower[15], fœnugreek[16],
bastard-saffron[17], _Turkey_ millet.

About _Aleppo_ they sow no oats, their horses being all fed with barley;
but near _Antioch_, and on the coast of _Syria_, I have seen some few
fields of them.

Near the city tobacco[18] is planted in the gardens only, but in the
villages about ten or fifteen miles off a large quantity is planted in
the fields, and all the hills from _Shogre_ to _Latachia_ produce such
plenty of this vegetable that it makes no inconsiderable branch of trade,
particularly with _Egypt_.

The harvest commences with the barley about the beginning of _May_, and
that, as well as the wheat, is generally all reaped by the twentieth of
the same month. The more wet the spring the later the harvest and the
more plentiful the crop. As soon as it is cut down, or rather pluck’d up,
(for this is their more usual way) it is carried to some neighbouring
spot of hard even ground, and there dislodged from its hulk by a machine
like a sledge, which runs upon two or three rollers, drawn by horses,
cows, or asses. In these rollers are fixed low iron wheels, notched like
the teeth of a law, and pretty sharp, at once cutting the straw and
separating the grain.

Their granaries are even at this day subterraneous grottos, the entry to
which is by a small hole or opening like a well, often in the high way,
and as they are commonly left open when empty, they make it not a little
dangerous riding near the villages in the night.

The cotton is not gathered till _October_, and such spots as are sown
with it yield a pleasant verdure when every thing else seems to be burnt
up. In the neighbourhood of _Aleppo_ there is no great quantity.

The olives produced about the city are, as I apprehend, very little more
than sufficient for pickling for the use of the inhabitants. But at
_Edlib_, about thirty miles to the south west, and the other villages
near it, they have large plantations affording yearly abundance of oil,
with which, and the ashes brought by the _Arabs_ from the desart, a very
considerable quantity of soap is annually made, some at _Aleppo_, but the
greatest part at _Edlib_.

When proper care is taken, the oil is very good, but as the people of
the country are not nice in their taste, they are less disposed to be
attentive about it.

The ricinus furnishes an oil which serves the common people for burning
in their lamps, and from the sesamum an oil likewise is extracted called
seerage, consumed chiefly by the _Jews_.

The vineyards round the city produce several sorts of tolerably good
grapes, sufficient for the supply of the markets. I need scarce mention
that the _Turks_ make no wine, but the _Christians_ and _Jews_ are
allowed to make sufficient for their own use, upon payment of a certain
tax; and the grapes for this purpose, as well as raisins, are all brought
from some distance. Their white wines are palatable, but thin and poor,
and seldom keep sound above a year. The red wine is deep-coloured,
strong, and heady, without any flavour, and much sooner produces sleep or
stupidity than mirth and elevation of spirits.

From the raisins, usually mixed with a few aniseeds, they draw an ardent
spirit, which they stile arrack, and of this the _Christians_ and _Jews_
drink pretty liberally.

The inspissated juice of the grape[19], called here dibbs, is brought
to the city in skins, and sold in the publick markets; it has much the
appearance of coarse honey, is of a sweet taste, and in great use among
the people of all sorts.

Though use seems the chief thing consulted in the laying out of their
gardens (except in a few where they have small summer-houses) and they
have not either fine walks, or any sort of ornament, yet, after what
has been said of the country, it will be easily imagined how agreeable
their verdure and shade must be in the hot weather, and consequently how
much they must be resorted to at that season. But this is not the only
refreshment they afford the inhabitants, for the markets are from them
plentifully supplied with several sorts of fruits, pot-herbs, roots,
and sallading; though, as they are obliged to use a great deal of water
(which they raise with the _Persian_ wheel) it must be owned that their
fruits in general have very little flavour, nor do they often stay till
they are ripe before they gather them. The following are all the variety
here produced.

Cherries three sorts; the common red cherry[20], the white heart
cherry[21], and _Visnia_ cherry[22]; apricots two sorts, one of which
has a sweet kernel, and is an exceeding good fruit, they ingraft it
upon the almond, and reckon its delicacy proceeds from that particular
circumstance[23]. Peaches but indifferent[24]; several sorts of
plumbs[25]; cornelian cherry[26]; two or three sorts of apples, but very
bad[27]; some indifferent good pears[28]; quinces[29]; pomegranates of
three sorts, sweet, sour, and another between both[30]; almonds[31];
black mulberries[32]; white mulberries in great abundance; with the
leaves of this tree the silk-worms are fed[33]; walnuts[34]; figs[35]
of four kinds; hazel-nuts[36], the kernels of which they parch and eat
between meals. Pistachio nuts[37], of a very good quality, and of which a
considerable quantity is yearly sent to _Europe_; jujubs[38]; olive[39];
sumach, used much as a relisher in many of their dishes[40]; one tree
only of St. _John_’s bread[41], is to be found in the gardens, though it
is very common on the coast, and the fruit sold in the bazars at _Aleppo_.

These trees are all standards planted promiscuously, and very little
obliged to culture. In some places they are thrown together in thickets,
in others they form inclosures for the beds of garden-stuff, in which
inclosures are also found the plane tree[42], white poplar[43], common
white willow[44]; another willow that bears a sweet-scented flower,
called by the natives baan, from whence they distill a simple cordial
water much used[45]. Horn-beam[46], a very few oaks[47], ash[48],
lilac[49], bead tree[50], a very few of the nettle trees[51],
oleaster[52], tamarisk[53], turpentine tree[54], a very few medlars[55],
elder[56], roses of various kinds[57], thorn[58], balaustine tree[59],
forming on the whole a wild and irregular but agreeable prospect.
The cypress trees[60] are generally planted nigh the house; the
black-berry[61] also grows wild all over the gardens. They have neither
goosberries nor currants now, though in _Rawolf_’s time there seems to
have been a few.

The pot-herbs, _&c._ produced by the gardens will be best ranged
according to the seasons in which they are most plentiful, in order
to give a clear idea of the food of the inhabitants in the different
seasons, for which reason also I shall here take the liberty to mention
several that have been already enumerated.

From the beginning of _November_ to the end of _March_, cabbage[62],
spinnage[63], endive[64], radishes of two sorts[65], turnips[66],
beet[67], carrot[68], are in great plenty; collyflowers[69] make their
appearance towards the end of _January_, are in great abundance in
_February_ and part of _March_, by the end of which month they become
scarce. _April_ and _May_ produce lettuces of different kinds[70],
beans[71], truffles[72], artichoaks[73], which are very small, and
chiefly eat by the natives when very young, so as when stew’d they eat
the whole; and pease[74].

The two last-mentioned remain in season all the month of _June_.
Purslane[75], and cucumbers[76] come in season also in _May_, and are in
plenty till the end of _July_; in _September_ and _October_ the latter
are again brought to market in great abundance, and towards the end of
this last mentioned month the young ones are gathered for pickling.

The months of _June_, _July_, and _August_ produce musk melons[77] in
great abundance; and a small cucumber called ajoor, which is often
extremely bitter. To these, in the month of _July_, are added water
melons[78], which we have in great perfection; Jews mallows[79]; kidney
beans[80]; adders cucumbers[81]; _Syrian_ mallow[82]; lupines[83]; as
also several kinds of gourds[84]; three species of mad apples[85], called
by the natives badinjan; which remain all _September_, and the latter as
far as the middle of _November_, making the principal part of the food
of the inhabitants during the months of _July_, _August_, _September_,
and _October_; and they are so fond of them, that they preserve them
various ways, so as to afford occasionally a dish through the whole
year. Squash[86] comes in towards the end of _September_, and continues
all the year. The orange-shaped pumpion[87] we have more common in
the summer-months. They have none of the colocassia at _Aleppo_, but
great quantities at _Tripoli_; where the shopkeepers use the leaves (as
_Rawolf_ mentions of _Aleppo_) instead of paper, for putting up their
wares.

The few following are to be met with at all seasons; parsley[88],
cress[89], mint[90], onions[91], and garlick[92]; which though they come
last in the list, yet they are far from being the least in use or esteem
among the natives.

In the gardens they also cultivate carraway[93], coriander[94],
dill[95], cypress canes[96], and common reed[97], both much used by the
manufacturers of silk and cotton stuffs, by way of reels, _&c._

Besides what have been already mentioned, which are produced by culture,
the fields afford the bugloss[98], mallow[99], and asparagus[100],
which they use as pot-herbs; the capper[101], which they pickle; the
dandelion[102], and water cresses[103], used in sallading; and the summer
savory[104], which, dried and powdered, and mixed with salt, they call
_zater_, and often eat as a relisher with bread, serving many of the
natives by way of breakfast in the winter-season; also the _Spanish_
nut[105]; and a species of hartwort[106], called by them _secacul_; both
which they eat crude.

In their little gardens they cultivate, besides the roses already
mentioned, the _Dutch_ hundred-leaf rose[107]; monthly rose[108], which,
by proper management, flowers about ten months in the year; a few
plants of the passion flower[109]; and several kinds of jasmin[110]:
oleander[111], and myrtle[112], grow plentifully in all the water’d parts
of _Syria_, but here only by culture. Henna[113] is kept in pots, and
preserved with great care from the inclemency of the winter, being much
esteemed on account of its sweet-scented flowers; _Spanish_ broom[114],
vervain mallow[115], night-shade[116], winter cherry[117]; and abundance
of flowers, several of which have been brought there by the _Europeans_,
and of which they are very fond, the women in particular, who decorate
their head-dress with them: of these the chief are the ranunculus
and anemony, carnation, hyacinth, narcissus, violet, tuberose[118],
_African_ marigold[119], lupines, sow-bread, _Indian_ bellflower[120],
marvel of _Peru_[121], columbine, stock-gelliflower. They also raise
in these little gardens _Guinea_ pepper[122], which they use as a
pickle; and love apples[123], which are but little ate by any of the
natives, except the Jews; rosemary[124], basil[125], flower gentle[126],
female balsamine[127], musk scabious, rue[128], wormwood[129]. The
common _Seville_ orange[130], the sweet _Seville_ orange[131], _China_
orange[132], common lemon[133], sweet lemon[134], and citron[135], are
also with care preserved here by the natives, for they will not bear a
severe winter in _Aleppo_; though they are in great abundance at _Byas_,
_Latachia_, _Tripoly_, and other places on the coast of _Syria_; from
whence the city is plentifully supplied with these fruits.

Neither my time, nor knowledge in botany, even though assisted by my
brother, who had a great deal more of both, were equal to the task of
making a compleat list of all the plants growing round _Aleppo_; but
though several may have been omitted, great care has been taken that
none should be inserted in the following account but what have been
determined with as much accuracy as possible.[136] It may not be improper
to observe, that the plants in general are of a much humbler growth here
than in most other parts.

Several plants have been already mentioned as flowering early in the
year, as hyacinth[137], daffodil[138], tulip[139], and violet[140]; but
the _Spanish_ nut is what may be called the harbinger of the spring, and
esteemed so by the natives, who are fond of its roots, which are sold at
this season in the publick streets in great quantities; and from this
time the botanizing season commences. Towards the middle of _February_
the banks of the river are covered with a small cranesbill[141]; and
about the same place is found the daizy[142], mentioned by _Rawolf_.
To these are quickly joined a profusion of plants, but chiefly in the
gardens and low grounds, meadow saffron[143]; flower-de-luce several
species[144], bulbous flower-de-luce[145], snow drop[146], ox eye[147],
marigold[148], archangel[149], fumitory[150], shepherds purse[151],
dandelion[152], hypecoon[153], grape hyacinth[154], saffron[155], great
variety of crowfoot[156], particularly one species (_ranuncul. vern.
rotundifol. minor_), that generally covers all the marshy parts of the
gardens.

As the spring advances, the following come on with surprising
rapidity. Madder[157], cleavers[158], periwinkle[159], plantain[160],
androsace[161], burnet[162], speedwell of many species[163], wake
robin[164] several species, dragons[165], several kinds of toad
flax[166], clary[167], sow bread[168], which near _Aleppo_ is chiefly
cultivated in their little gardens, but very common on the mountains;
various sorts of clarey[169], three species of charlock[170],
_Mithridate_ mustard[171], bastard _Mithridate_ mustard[172],
stock-gellyflower[173], dames violet[174] four species, wild

two kinds[187], spurges several species[188], horehound[189], field
_Basil_[190], treacle-mustard[191], woad[192], hemlock[193], water
parsnip[194], navel-wort[195], brank ursine[196], gold of pleasure[197],
flix-weed[198], horned wild cumin[199], sweet fern[200], bastard
parsley[201], shrub hartwort[202], scorching carrot[203].

And towards the middle of _April_ the country is in its full bloom, the
verdure of the fields being beautifully variegated by poppies[204],
bellflower[205], gromel[206], comfrey[207], mullein[208], sage[209],
rocket[210], hedge-mustard[211], mustard[212], horned poppy[213],
great variety of campions[214], pimpernel[215], figwort[216], berry
bearing chickweed[217], flax[218], corn-flag[219], lilly daffodil[220],
larkspur[221], bugloss[222], ladies bed-straw[223], birthwort[224],
ironwort[225], skull-cap[226], trifoil[227], melilot[228], calves
snout[229], _Moldavian_ balm[230], medick[231], rest harrow[232], goats
rue[233], bastard rocket[234], kidney vetch[235], corn sallet[236],
two species of satyrion[237], knapweed[238], hatchet vetch[239],
columbine[240], scabious[241]. Nor are the stoney, uncultivated rising
grounds without their plants; as thyme[242], vipers buglos[243], ground
pine[244], cress[245], common whitlow grass[246], madwort[247],
eryngo[248], St. _Foin_ several species[249], birds foot[250], horse-shoe
vetch[251], birds foot trefoil[252], moon trefoil[253], vetch several
kinds[254], milk vetch[255], betony[256], knapweed[257].

Among the rank herbage in the gardens are found at this season,
borage[258], _German_ madwort[259], hounds tongue[260], broom
rape[261], mint[262], rush[263], balm[264], thyme[265], vervain[266],
dittander[267], hollyhock[268], cinquefoil[269], lilly[270],
burdock[271], but in small quantity; mug-wort[272]. But among the plants
that adorn the fields at this season, no one is more conspicuous or
common than the lion-leaf[273]: nor should we here omit a beautiful
species of henbane[274], with a strong musk smell; which seems to be the
_hyosciamus rubello flore_, _C. B. P. 169._ though the peculiarity of its
smell I do not find has been mentioned.

[Illustration: _Pla 5 facing Page 41._

_Tragacantha Orientalis vesicaria erectior caule ab imo ad Summum florido_

_G. D. Ehret delin:_ _I. Mynde sc:_]

As the heats come on, the few following plants being of a hardier nature,
are the only ones that are capable of resisting them. Wild or _Syrian_
rue[275], bean capers[276], capers[277], which grow in plenty on the
tops of old houses; kings spear[278] several species; a variety of
stars of _Bethlem_[279], liquorice[280], night-shade[281], fennel[282],
blessed thistle[283], wild cucumber[284]. Nothing now remains of the
spring-plants in the open fields.

Of the plants that belong to the summer, except the following, al
hagy[285], a very low kind of acacia[286], goats thorn[287], kali[288],
several species of thistles[289], and the gundelia[290], the greatest
part are to be found under the shade, or nigh the little channels where
the water runs in the gardens. _Molucca_ balm[291], base horehound[292],
bastard horehound[293], dwarf oleander[294], ricinoides[295], thorn
apple[296], turnsole[297], leadwort[298], pimpernel[299], teasel[300].
After the first rains in the autumn, the fields every where throw out the
autumnal lilly daffodil; and the few plants which had stood the summer
now glow with fresh vigour.

Besides what plants have been already enumerated, the country produces
the camomile-like ox-eye[301], sneezwort[302], yarrow[303], cats
foot[304], fleabane[305], several sorts of grass[306], ragweed[307],
stinking orach[308], wild orach[309], vipers grass[310], ox-eye[311],
_May_ weed[312], corn marigold[313], goats beard[314], _Achilles_’s
yarrow[315], _American_ night-shade[316], chickling[317], chickling
vetch[318], _French_ honeysuckle[319], fever-few[320], chamomile[321],
hemp[322], sharp-pointed dock[323], bloodwort[324], pellitory of
the wall[325], true maiden-hair[326], nettle[327], starry hawkweed
succory[328], groundsell[329]. The weeping willow[330] should likewise
have been mentioned before, which is very common in the gardens.

And the river affords plenty of the yellow water-lilly[331], from whence
the natives distil a cordial-water much used by them.

I never travelled through _Syria_, either with a botanical view, or at
the proper season; so that I cannot pretend to give any tolerable account
of the plants growing at any distance from _Aleppo_. The few, however,
that came to my knowledge, I shall just mention. On the mountains
grow several sorts of oaks, pines, myrtle, juniper, bay, St. _John_’s
bread, kermes, azarole, the fruit of which is brought to market in the
autumn; and the andrachne in such plenty, that it affords nigh one half
of the wood used for fuel in _Aleppo_. The shining red of its bark,
together with the beauty of its flowers and fruit, will, I doubt not,
make it esteemed as a valuable acquisition to the _British_ gardens,
if it agree with our climate, which the thriving condition of several
plants raised here seems to promise. The bindweed[332], from whence
the _Aleppo_ scammony of the shops is procured, does not grow near the
city, but chiefly on the mountains. This drug is the inspissated milky
juice that flows from the root by incision; and each produces but a very
small quantity. As the plant grows wild, it is the property of any one
that will take the trouble to look for it, which is the employment of
some peasants at the proper season; and having collected what they can
of the milky liquor, they carry it to the nearest village of any note,
where there are always some traders (chiefly _Jews_) ready to purchase
it of them; and these people generally mix it with wheat flour, sand,
ashes, _&c._ so that at present very little is brought quite pure to
market at _Aleppo_. It does not appear that any thing it is adulterated
with increases its violence in operating; on the contrary, the purer the
scammony, the smaller I have always found the dose: so that the notion of
its being mixed with the juice of the spurge seems without foundation.
However, the proportion of the heterogeneous substances mixed with it
being various, renders the dose of the medicine as found in the shops
very uncertain, and so occasions its being seldomer prescribed than
so safe and efficacious a purgative otherwise deserves. For further
particulars relating to this plant, see _Medical Observations and
Inquiries_, Vol. I.—At the bottom of the page is a catalogue of such
other plants as have come within my observation on the mountains, and in
other parts of _Syria_[333].

There are no metals found any where near _Aleppo_, or, so far as I know
of, in all _Syria_; though some of the rocky hills from their appearance
seem to contain an iron ore. Nigh to _Antioch_ a few garnets are picked
up, but of an inferior quality.

The soil has been already mentioned. They have scarce any clay; and, what
they do meet with, has so little tenacity, that it is with difficulty
they can form a very ordinary sort of bricks; which, as well as the
water-jars they make of it, frequently fall to pieces of themselves. The
potters clay, of which the holes of their pipes are made, is brought from
_Damascus_ and _Sidon_.

About six hours from _Aleppo_ is found a sort of fullers earth, called by
the natives _bayloon_, which is often used in the bagnio instead of soap,
and particularly by the women for cleansing their hair; for which purpose
it is kept in balls, made up with rose-leaves, to give it an agreeable
smell. I may add, that a good deal of it is ate by longing women, and
such as have a depraved appetite from a chlorosis.

For common buildings they make use of a white gritty stone, every where
plenty about the town; and is very proper for the purpose, as it is
easily cut, and grows hard afterwards. For the gateways, pillars, and
pavements of their best buildings, they employ a yellow marble, which
is capable of a tolerable polish, and is likewise the produce of this
country. This is often intermixed with a red, white, and coarse black
marble in their buildings, by way of ornament. None of the three last
mentioned are found in the neighbourhood of _Aleppo_; being brought, the
first from _Damascus_; the second, either from _Italy_, or extracted
from old buildings, chiefly about _Antioch_; and the last, both from
_Damascus_ and _Killis_. When they are in want of the red, they can dye
the yellow marble of _Aleppo_, so as to have much the same appearance, by
rubbing it over with oil, and then putting it into a moderately-hot oven
for some hours. The slight partition-walls are built of a coarse sort of
chalk, of which there is abundance to the northward of the city.

Lime-stone is met with in plenty near the city, affording them good
cement for their buildings; which they carry on with great ease and
dexterity, and generally without any scaffolding. A few hours distance is
found the gypsum in small quantities, of which their plaister of _Paris_
is made. This is chiefly used in cementing the earthen pipes employed in
carrying water, and for a few other purposes about their best buildings.

About eighteen miles south-east from _Aleppo_, is a large plain, which we
generally call the _Valley of Salt_, bounded with low, rocky hills, so
as to form a kind of natural bason, which keep in the rains descending
from them, together with the water derived from a few springs in the
neighbourhood, and cause the whole to be entirely covered with water in
the winter. The extent and evenness of the surface, however, prevents
this water from collecting to any great depth; so that it is soon
evaporated by the summer’s heat, and leaves a cake of salt in some places
not less than half an inch thick, but it is more or less in proportion to
the quantity of rain that falls in the winter; and with this crust the
whole inclosed plain is covered. The soil of this plain is a stiff clay,
and strongly impregnated with salt; but I could not discover that the
springs above mentioned had any taste communicated by this mineral.

In the month of _August_ a number of people are employed in gathering
this salt; which is of a good quality, and in quantity proves sufficient
to supply all this part of the country.

What few black cattle they have near the city, are chiefly used for the
plough, or drawing water for the gardens. The greatest part of those
employed for this purpose are very large, with remarkably long legs, and
a gaunt belly, such as we often see on antique _intaglios_. The other
cattle of this species are small, and all in general have very short
horns.

The _Turks_ or _Jews_ scarce ever eat beef, and it is but of late that
the _Christians_ have begun to be fond of it; so that what is killed is
chiefly for the _Europeans_, who have it tolerably good at all seasons,
but best in summer, as the natives to this day religiously observe the
ancient custom of allowing the oxen employed in separating the corn from
the straw to eat what they please.

In some parts of _Syria_ there are abundance of buffaloes, but near
_Aleppo_ very few, and these chiefly kept for milk. Mutton is plentiful,
fat, and good the whole year, except a few weeks in the spring, and makes
by far the greater part of the animal food of all ranks of people. Lamb
is also to be had in every season, but in greatest plenty in _February_,
_March_, and _April_.

They have two sorts of sheep in the neighbourhood of _Aleppo_: the one
called _Beduin_ sheep, which differ in no respect from the larger kinds
of sheep in _Britain_, except that their tails are somewhat longer and
thicker: the others are those often mentioned by travellers on account of
their extraordinary tails; and this species is by much the most numerous.
This tail is very broad and large, terminating in a small appendix that
turns back upon it. It is of a substance between fat and marrow; and
is not eaten separately, but mixed with the lean meat in many of their
dishes, and also often used instead of butter. A common sheep of this
sort, without the head, feet, skin, and entrails, weighs about twelve
or fourteen _Aleppo_ rotoloes[334], of which the tail is usually three
rotoloes or upwards; but such as are of the largest breed, and have
been fattened, will sometimes weigh above thirty rotoloes, and the tails
of these ten; a thing to some scarce credible. These very large sheep
being about _Aleppo_ kept up in yards, are in no danger of injuring
their tails; but in some other places, where they feed in the fields,
the shepherds are obliged to fix a piece of thin board to the under part
of the tail, to prevent its being torn by bushes, thistles, _&c._ as it
is not covered underneath with thick wool like the upper part; and some
have small wheels, to facilitate the dragging of this board after them;
whence, with a little exaggeration, the story of having carts to carry
their tails.

This thin skin on the under part of the tail is much used by the natives
for pains and swellings of all sorts, being applied warm to the part
affected, and allowed to remain on till it stinks abominably; and as
they are very often applied to the head and abdomen in fevers, this last
circumstance makes them prove generally detrimental: and indeed I have
seldom, if ever, seen much benefit received by their application, except
in some old rheumatic pains.

[Illustration: _Facing Page 52_

_J. Mynde sc._]

They have also two kinds of goats; one that differs little from the
common sort in _Britain_; the other as remarkable for the length of its
ears, as the sheep above mentioned for the largeness of their tails. The
size of the animal is somewhat larger than ours; but their ears are often
a foot long, and broad in proportion. They are chiefly kept for their
milk, of which they yield no inconsiderable quantity; and it is sweet,
and well-tasted. Great numbers of them are brought to the city about the
beginning of _April_, and are drove through the streets every morning,
and their milk sold as they pass, till _September_. The other part of
the year they are generally supplied with cows milk, such as it is; for
as they are commonly kept at the gardens, and fed with their refuse, the
milk generally tastes so strong of garlick or cabbage leaves, as to be
very disagreeable. Besides the milk of the goats, their kids add some
part to the diet of the inhabitants, a few being killed in the spring and
autumn.

Butter and cheese, both of which are bad, are made indiscriminately of
the milk from cows, buffaloes, sheep, or goats: and the city is supplied
with these things, as well as with cattle of all kinds, by the _Arabs_,
_Rushwans_, or _Turkmen_; all of whom place their wealth, or at least
derive their subsistence from those animals, and travel about the country
with their flocks, much in the same way as the patriarchs did of old.

Leban[335] is brought in great plenty to the city during the winter and
spring, and is a favourite dish with the inhabitants.

The country round _Aleppo_ abounds with antelopes; which are of two
sorts: that which is called the mountain antelope is the most beautiful;
its back and neck are of a dark brown colour: the antelope of the plain
is not either so swift or well-made, and is of a much lighter colour.
Both sorts afford no small diversion to the sportsmen; but are so
extremely fleet, that the greyhounds, though very good, can seldom take
them without the assistance of a falcon, unless in soft deep ground.
In the sporting season they are lean, but have a good flavour. In the
summer, when fat, they may vie even with our venison in _England_.
But this is to be understood of such as are caught abroad, for those
that have been fattened in the houses are not so delicious. From this
account it will easily be conceived, that such dainties only make their
appearance at the tables of the _Europeans_, and a few of the more
considerable _Turks_.

Hares are in great plenty, and also afford good sport; but the natives
are not fond of them, except the _Arabs_, whose method of dressing them
is particular, and said to be very good. They dig a hole in the earth,
which they fill with such light brushwood as they can pick up, and set
it on fire: when thoroughly lighted, the hare, the flue, the entrails,
and all together just as it was taken, is thrown into it; and, after the
flame has ceased, they cover the hole up with the loose earth that had
been dug out of it, and which at first had been laid round the verge of
the fire, so as to grow hot: thus it is left till they judge it to be
sufficiently roasted, when throwing a quantity of salt over it, they eat
it without any further dressing.

A few tame rabbits are kept in the city, chiefly for the tables of the
_Europeans_; and now and then a wild hog is brought from abroad, which,
though seldom fat, yet is esteemed by us, as it is a rarity.

The country also affords a few porcupines, which are sometimes, though
seldom, ate by the _Europeans_; and land-turtle and frogs in great
abundance, which furnish a dish for the _Franks_ of the _Romish_
religion, and for many of the native Christians, in their lents.

These are the animals which are commonly dressed for food by the
inhabitants of _Aleppo_; for the camel, though reckoned a delicious
morsel by the _Arabs_, makes no part of their diet. This creature,
however, is of the utmost consequence to them in transporting from place
to place every thing for which they have occasion; there being no such
thing as a wheel-carriage in all this part of the country, except a very
clumsy machine, now and then used for bringing large pillars, or other
stones of great weight, from the quarry.

There are four sorts of camels known here, _viz._ the _Turkman_ camel,
the _Arab_ camel, the dromedary, and the camel with two bunches on its
back.

The _Turkman_ camel is much stronger, larger, more woolly or hairy, and
of a darker colour, than any of the others. Their common load is 160
rotoloes, or 800 pounds; but sometimes it carries much more. This animal
cannot bear heat, and therefore they never work it in the months of
_June_, _July_, and _August_.

The _Arab_ camel is much smaller than the former, of a lighter colour,
and not so hairy. This seldom carries above 100 rotoloes, but can bear
the heat and thirst much better than the _Turkman_; nor is there any need
that the _Arab_ camel be fed with barleyflour and chopp’d straw; for the
dry thistles, and other plants which grow on the desart, are almost all
it requires, and it feeds as it goes along with its burthen. I remember
an instance, where, in a caravan from _Bussorah_, the camels which were
of this sort travelled without water for fifteen days; but the quantity
they drank as soon as they could come at any, proved fatal to many of
them.

The dromedary, by all I could ever discover, is nothing but a high breed
of the _Arab_ camel. The only distinction observed is, that it is of a
lighter and handsomer make; and, instead of the solemn walk to which the
others are accustomed, it paces, and is generally esteemed to go as far
in one day as the others do in three.

The camel with two bunches on its back is of _Persian_ breed, and, except
a few that come in the caravans from _Bagdad_ and _Bussorah_, is but
seldom seen here. The only distinction between it and the _Arab_ camel
seems to be its having two bunches, whereas the other sorts have but one.

In mentioning their beasts of burthen, the ass ought not to be omitted:
of which they have two sorts; one very large, with remarkably long ears;
the other small, and much like ours in _England_; both of no contemptible
use in carrying all lighter burdens to and from the parts adjacent to the
city.

Formerly this part of the country was famous for fine horses; and
though many good ones are still bred here, it may be said they are much
degenerated. Those of the _Arab_ breed are slight, and not very handsome,
but esteemed for their fleetness. The _Turkman_ horses are larger, of a
stronger make, and more sightly appearance; and therefore more valued by
the people of fashion among the _Turks_, whose large furniture does not
show to advantage upon a small horse. They are for the most part very
well broke, and particularly taught to go off in full speed at once, and
stop as quickly; so that in the space of a few yards the rider can lay
them out at full stretch, and stop and turn them. Far the greater part
are stone-horses, but in general not vicious; and it is observed of most
of their animals, that they are exceeding gentle and familiar with the
human species.

Among the rocky hills there are hyænas; but they are not so large as
those which are found in the mountains[336].

If this animal could formerly imitate the human voice, and learn some
of the shepherds names, so as to call them out and devour them, as some
writers have reported, it is more than they do at present, being, so
far as I can learn, fonder of the flocks than of the shepherd. However,
though they will not attack men but in their own defence, or through
excess of hunger; yet they still retain the character of robbing
sepulchres when they have an opportunity.

Wolves and foxes are found in the champaign, but smaller than those in
_Europe_; and jackalls are in so great plenty about the gardens, that
they pass in numbers like a pack of hounds in full cry every evening,
giving not only disturbance by their noise, but making free with the
poultry and other provisions, if very good care is not taken to keep them
out of their reach.

I might be excused from mentioning their dogs, which abound in the
streets without any owner, were it not that I think it worth observing,
that though they live upon the most putrid substances, have but little
water, and in so excessive hot a climate as this is in the summer, yet no
instance has been known of any of them running mad. Their wolves however
seem to be subject to madness; for the rusticks talk much of an animal
called a _sheeb_, which they imagine to be generated between a wolf and
a dog; but, from their description of it, _viz._ that it is so like a
wolf as not to be distinguished from it; that it attacks every person or
animal that comes in its way, all of whom die raving mad, _&c._ I think
it would appear that this animal is no other than a mad wolf.

Their greyhounds are of a very light, slender make, and remarkably fleet.
Their ears are longer than ours in _Britain_, and, as well as their tail,
covered with a long, soft hair, which adds very much to their beauty.

Though _Mount Taurus_, near to _Maraash_, gives shelter to the ounce,
and some few tygers are found in most of the high mountains, the lion
on the _Euphrates_ between _Bagdad_ and _Bussorah_, and the jerboa on
the desart, and perhaps on examination many other animals in the same
places; yet my present purpose only comprehending the parts adjacent to
_Aleppo_, what I have already said on this subject may perhaps be thought
sufficient.

As to reptiles, insects, _&c._ time would not permit me to be minute;
so that I shall just mention such as are hurtful or of use to the
inhabitants, and a few of those that are most commonly met with. Of the
first sort are the serpents of various kinds, with which the country
abounds, many of them of the most venomous nature; but as they all fly
from man, and the barrenness of the fields in summer, the only season in
which they are abroad, prevents either their being surprised, or people’s
treading upon them undesignedly, no great number of accidents happen. In
the houses there are often found large white snakes; but I never knew
any one bit by them. The scolopendra and scorpion however very often
sting the natives in their houses, causing pain for several hours, but
attended with no farther bad consequences.

Of the noxious kind may well be reckoned the locust, which sometimes
arrive in such incredible multitudes, that it would appear fabulous to
relate, destroying the whole of the verdure where-ever they pass: but
though there are always in the spring and summer some of two or three
different species to be met with about _Aleppo_, yet none of these
destructive flights of them appeared during my stay there. It may not be
amiss to mention that the _Arabs_ eat this insect when fresh, and also
salt them up as a delicacy.

Of insects for use, we have only the bee, which produces excellent honey,
and the silk-worm, now sufficiently known all over _Europe_, as well as
the method of managing them in order to procure the silk; of which there
is but very little made nigh _Aleppo_: though that being the market to
which it is brought from all parts of _Syria_, great quantities are sent
from thence yearly to _Britain_.

Various sorts of lizards are found in great abundance over the whole
country, and in the gardens a few tree-frogs[337]. It is worth observing,
that toads are scarce ever seen here, though common enough upon the coast.

The view with which these sheets were composed, it is hoped, will
sufficiently apologize for beginning the account of the feathered tribe
with such as are used for food by the inhabitants. Of domestic fowls,
they have in their markets, the dunghill cock and hen[338]; the _Bagdad_
fowl which is of a large breed; the rumkin[339], or cock and hen without
rumps; the turkey[340], goose[341], and duck[342]. Of game there are
on the river in winter, the water hen[343], water rail[344], wild
goose[345], plenty of common wild duck and mallard[346], several kinds of
widgeon[347], coot[348], spoon-bill[349], and various sorts of teal[350],
with which the tables of the _Europeans_ are plentifully supplied, and
some ate also by the natives.

In the winter there are also plenty of wood-cocks[351]; spring and autumn
produce abundance of quails[352] and rails[353]. In the last mentioned
season the witwall[354] and becca figos are both in season, and (the last
in particular) esteemed as delicacies.

[Illustration: _facing page 64_ _Pl: 9._]

In the months of _May_ and _June_ great numbers of a bird, called by the
natives _kata_ (which are also to be met with at all seasons, though
not in so great plenty), are brought to market, and much ate by them;
but their flesh is so black, hard, and dry, that the _Europeans_ never
touch them. As this bird has not as yet been described, a figure and
description of it are annexed[355]. Other game in the neighbourhood
are, the bustard[356] of two kinds; red-legg’d partridge[357];
frankolin[358], the flesh of which is delicious, but this bird is not
to be met with at less than a day’s journey from the city; common
sky-lark[359], wood-lark[360], crested lark[361], calandra[362];
hortulanes[363], and citrils[364], chiefly ate by the _French_;
snipe[365], gird or jack snipe[366], song-thrush[367], wind-thrush[368],
turtle-dove[369]; a brown-coloured dove, which builds in the windows,
_&c._ of the houses in the city; and another much like it, only
speckled on the neck and pinions, which is very common when the corn
is ripe, but disappears as soon as that is reaped; wild pigeon, wood
pigeon[370]. They have also variety of tame pigeons, and particularly
the carrier[371], formerly made use of by the _Europeans_ for conveying
expeditiously the news of a ship’s arrival at _Scanderoon_; but this
practice has been disused for many years. The pigeon thus employed was
one that had young at _Aleppo_. Upon enquiring into their method of
training them, some asserted, that they were sent down to _Scanderoon_
in an open cage, and, as soon as let go there, would fly directly to
_Aleppo_. But I am more apt to believe what others affirmed, that
the bird was brought to this by first letting it return from shorter
distances on the _Scanderoon_ road. All agree, that if the pigeon had
been a fortnight at _Scanderoon_, it was not afterwards to be trusted to
fly back, lest it should have forgot its young, and consequently not be
so eager to get home. A small piece of paper, with the ship’s name, day
of arrival, and what else material could be contained in a very narrow
compass, was fixed so as to be under the wing, to prevent its being
destroyed by wet. They also used to bathe their feet in vinegar, with a
view to keeping them cool, so as they might not settle to drink or wash
themselves, which would have destroyed the paper. And I have heard an
_English_ gentleman, who remembered that practice, say, that he has known
them arrive in two hours and an half.

Shooting, as a sport, is rarely followed by any of the natives, though
many practise it to gain a livelihood; but the diversions of coursing and
hawking are in great esteem among the people of fashion. They have both
in great perfection; but the latter exceeds any thing of the kind that I
have ever met with. The falcons bred for taking hares and antelopes are
the _Baraban_ and _Sefy_, both large falcons; and, though caught wild,
they train them in a few days to fly at their prey.

For antelope-hawking, they chuse such of these hawks as they find to be
fierce, and eager to seize their prey; and they are taught to fix upon
the cheek of the animal, which retards its motion, so that the greyhounds
come in.

Though the falcons used for hare-hawking will sometimes, when very
hungry, strike the hare dead at once; yet for this sport they prefer
such as are not disposed to fix upon the animal, but who, by repeated
buffetting on the head with their pounces (rising in the air between
each blow), retard the hare, till an ordinary greyhound can come up and
seize it.

For bird-hawking, they use a large falcon, with long legs, somewhat like
the goshawk, which they call _espeer_; and two smaller falcons, stiled
the one _zanous_, and the other _shaheen_. This latter must be taken
out of the nest, for when old they cannot be trained, and is so fierce
that it will fly at any thing. If there were not several gentlemen now
in _England_ who can attest it, I should scarce venture to mention, that
with the _shaheen_, which is about the size of a pigeon, they often take
the largest eagles, of which in this country there are plenty. They
formerly were trained to seize the eagle under the wing: and so depriving
him of the use of that part, they fell to the ground together: but their
present method, as I am informed, is to seize him on the back between the
two wings, which has the same effect, but brings him down more slowly,
and so gives the falconer time to come in to his hawk’s assistance; in
which if he is not very expeditious, the hawk is in either case speedily
destroyed.

They have also a small hawk, which they train to fly at quails; it much
resembles the spar-hawk.

Besides those already mentioned for food and sport, the country produces
the black vulture[372], some few pelicans[373], the kestrel[374], white
stork[375], black stork[376], great eagle-owl[377], several other kinds
of smaller owls, the crane[378]; another beautiful sort of crane[379],
called by the natives _querky_, which they have often tame in their
houses or court-yards; the common heron[380], the flamingo[381] at some
seasons, the cormorant[382], the stone curlew[383], the raven[384], the
_Royston_ crow[385], the common or carrion crow[386], the jackdaw[387],
the magpye[388], the night raven[389], the starling[390], the common
blackbird[391]; a kind of jay, whose feathers are beautifully variegated
with blue, green, and a sort of brown; as also in the summer the locust
bird[392].

The black caps[393], a sort of gull, are in great numbers about the city
all the winter, and so tame that the women call them from the terraces,
throwing up pieces of bread, which these birds catch in the air. The
house-swallow[394], martin[395], and swift[396], of which, besides
the common, there is one with a white belly, come about the end of
_February_; and having hatched their young, disappear about the end of
_July_. The swallow returns again the beginning of _October_, but stays
not above a fortnight. The hopooe[397] and bee-eater[398] come in the
spring, and remain all the summer and autumn.

[Illustration: _facing page 71._ _Pl: 10._

_J. S. M. del et. Sc:_]

Of small birds the following are what I have observed. The
house-sparrow[399], the chaffinch[400], the goldfinch[401], the common
linnet[402], the field-fare[403], the white water-wagtail[404], the
cuckow[405], the king-fisher[406], the greater spotted wood-pecker[407],
the stone-chatter[408], the wren[409], a _Brasilian_ bird a-kin to the
king-fisher[410], green plover[411], grey plover[412]; and abundance of
nightingales[413], which not only afford much pleasure by their song in
the gardens, but are also kept tame in the houses, and let out at a small
rate to divert such as chuse it in the city; so that no entertainments
are made in the spring without a concert of these birds.

There are also several other birds, which I could not determine from any
books I had, and my occasions did not allow me to preserve; besides which
I doubt not there are many others which escaped my searches: so that I
can only add a remarkable sort of bittern[414], and a bird somewhat like
a lapwing[415], with a remarkable spur in its pinnion: the figure and
description of both which are annexed.

From the _Euphrates_ and _Orontes_ in the winter, particularly the Lent
of the Christians, are brought a sufficient quantity of fish for their
consumption; but the _Turks_ seldom eat any: and indeed most of them
taste so muddy, that they are disagreeable.

[Illustration: _facing page 72._ _Pl: 11._]

[Illustration: _facing page 73._ _Plate 12._

_F. Perry Sculp._]

The different kinds that I have observed are carp[416], Mystus Niloticus
Bellonii[417], barbel[418], nasus[419], tœnia cornuta Schonfeldii[420],
eel[421]; and there are likewise some other sorts that I had not an
opportunity of examining; but none are in such abundance as what are
called the _black fish_, with which the markets are plentifully supplied
from the entrance of the winter till the beginning of _March_; when they
are esteemed out of season. As this fish, to the best of my knowledge,
is of a genus not yet described, a figure and description of it are
inserted[422].

Besides the fish which we have mentioned, most of those that are found in
the _Aleppo_ river, are likewise brought from abroad, and known in town
by the same names.

The sheat fish[423] is also sometimes to be met with, and is caught in a
lake near _Marash_.

I did not imagine, from the appearance of the river _Coic_, or indeed
from what is commonly met with at the tables of the inhabitants, that
our list of fish caught there would have swelled to any thing worth
mentioning; and yet, upon examination, they were found to amount to no
less than seventeen, and even some of these not yet described. They are
in general very small, occasioned in part by the assiduous industry of
the fishermen; for at _Hylan_, and the _Fountain of Fish_, where they
remain unmolested, they grow to larger sizes, though very rarely so
large as in other parts of the world.

The loche[424] is the most common; the barbel is less than those brought
from abroad. The bleak[425] is known by two names; that is, there are
two sorts of fish that appear to agree in every characteristic with
the bleak, which nevertheless are esteemed different; the first called
_mirmeed_, seven or eight inches long; the second, _tiftaf_, is not
above one and a half or two inches, and, they say, never exceeds.
Chub[426] are plenty; roches[427] seldom large; gudgeons[428] of three
sorts; the first is much spotted on the back, and called _tuckle_; the
second, _kureety_, has fewer spots; the third, _kalloor_, scarce any,
and is smaller than the other two. The mugilis[429] I am less certain of
than the rest, but yet it agrees tolerably well with the description;
dace[430], carassius[431], the phoxinus[432]; also a fish called by
the natives _simak il inglese_[433], from a corruption, I suppose, of
_anguilla_, as it has been commonly imagined to be a kind of eel; though,
upon examination, it is found to be a genus hitherto undescribed; and two
species of mystus[434][435]: of which three, as I have met with nothing
like them in other authors, I have given descriptions and drawings. There
are also, on the banks of the river, crabs in abundance, which are much
eat by the native Christians, and which often furnish the tables of the
_Europeans_ with a delicate dish.

[Illustration: _facing page 76._ Pl: XIII.

_F. Perry Sculp._]

The inhabitants of _Aleppo_, though of different religions, yet seem
to be much the same people. I wish I could say that those who profess
Christianity were better than their neighbours. The number of souls in
the city and suburbs is computed at about 235,000, of whom 200,000 are
_Turks_, 30,000 _Christians_, and 5000 _Jews_[436]. Of the Christians,
the greater number, are _Greeks_; next to them the _Armenians_, then
the _Syrians_, and lastly the _Maronites_; each of whom have a church
in the suburbs called _Judida_; in which quarter, and parts adjacent,
most of them reside. The language generally spoke is vulgar _Arabic_.
The _Turks_ of condition use the _Turkish_. Most of the _Armenians_ can
speak _Armenian_, some few _Syrians_ understand _Syriac_, and many of
the _Jews_ _Hebrew_; but scarce one of the _Greeks_ understand a word of
_Greek_, either ancient or modern.

The people in general are of a middle stature, rather lean than fat,
indifferently well made, but not either vigorous or active. Those of the
city are of a fair complexion; but the peasants, and such as are obliged
to be much abroad in the sun, are swarthy. Their hair is commonly black,
or of a dark chesnut-colour; and it is very rare to see any other than
black eyes amongst them. Both sexes are tolerably handsome when young;
but the beard soon disfigures the men; and the women, as they come early
to maturity[437], fade also as soon, and in general look old by the time
they reach thirty. The greater part of the women are married from the age
of fourteen to eighteen, and often sooner. The tender passion of love can
have very little share in promoting matrimony among them, for the young
folks never see one another till the ceremony is performed. A slender
waist, far from being admired, is, on the contrary, rather looked on as a
deformity in the ladies of this country; so that they do all they can to
make themselves plump and lusty.

The men are girt very tight round the middle with a sash. The womens
girdles are not only very slight and narrow, but loosely put on; which,
with the warmth of the climate, and frequent use of the bagnio, is
probably one principal reason why their labours are much easier than
those in _Britain_; the most delicate being seldom confined above ten or
twelve days, and those of the villages are rarely hindered from going
about their usual employments the next day. Women of all conditions
suckle their own children, and seldom wean them, till either the mother
is again with child, or they arrive at the age of three, and sometimes
four years.

The people of distinction in _Aleppo_ may justly be esteemed courteous
and polite, if allowance is made for that superiority which the
_Mohammedan_ religion teaches those who profess it to assume over all
who are of another faith. And as this prejudice is observed to encrease
among the people in proportion to their vicinity to _Mecha_, the
natives of _Aleppo_ have still a much greater proportion than those
of _Constantinople_, _Smyrna_, and other parts at a greater distance;
though, even here, it has greatly declined within these few years,
insomuch that several _bashaws_ have conferred many public honours and
civilities on the _Europeans_, that formerly would have caused great
popular discontent. As to the common people, an affected gravity, with
some share of dissimulation, is too much their characteristic. And though
few in the world are more given to harsh language and quarrelling, yet
none are less guilty of fighting. One can seldom pass a few yards in the
street without being witness to some noisy broil; yet in many years you
may perhaps never see one blow struck, except the person who gives it is
very well assured that it will not be returned. But though they are so
prone to anger upon the most trifling occasions, yet no people in the
universe can be more calm when it is their interest so to be. This, I am
sorry to say, is but too generally a true representation: but it would be
very ungrateful, as well as unjust in me, not to acknowledge that there
are many amongst them of all sects who deserve a much better character,
and whom I know, from repeated experience, to be persons of the utmost
honour and integrity.

Their usual bread is of wheat flour, not well fermented, made into thin
flat cakes ill-baked, and for the most part ate soon after it comes out
of the oven. The better sort have small loaves of a finer flour, well
fermented, and well baked. Besides these, there are a variety of rusks
and biscuits, most of which are either strowed on the top with the seeds
of sesamum or fennel-flower. The _Europeans_ have very good bread, baked
in the _French_ manner.

Coffee made very strong, and without either sugar or milk, is a
refreshment in very high esteem with every body; and a dish of it,
preceded by a little wet sweet-meat (commonly conserve of red roses,
acidulated with lemon-juice), and a pipe of tobacco, is the usual
entertainment at a visit. If they have a mind to use less ceremony, the
sweet-meat is omitted; and, if they would shew an extraordinary degree
of respect, they add sherbet, (some syrup, chiefly that of lemons, mixed
with water) a sprinkling of rose or other sweet-scented water, and the
perfume, with aloes-wood, which is brought last, and serves as a sign
that it is time for the stranger to take his leave. This is looked upon
as an entertainment sufficient for the greatest men in the country,
only that such have a piece of embroidered or flowered silk thrown over
their knee when they drink the coffee and sherbet: and if it is a visit
of ceremony from a _bashaw_, or other person in power, a fine horse,
sometimes with furniture, or some such valuable present, is made him at
his departure. People of inferior rank (or even others, if they have any
favour to ask) commonly bring a small present (a flower is frequently
thought sufficient) when they visit.

Tobacco is smoked to excess by all the men, and many of the women. Even
the labourers or handicraft-tradesmen have constantly a pipe in their
mouths, if they can afford it. Those pipes are made of the twig of a
rose-bush, cherry-tree, _&c._ bored for that purpose: those of the better
sort are five or six feet long, and adorned with silver. The bole is of
clay, and often changed; but the pipes themselves last for years. Many
who are in easy circumstances have lately adopted the _Persian_ manner of
smoking the nargeery[438]; which is an instrument so constructed, that
the smoke of the tobacco passes through the water before it comes into
the mouth. The method of drawing it is different from that of a pipe;
and a good part of the smoke seems to descend some way into the breast.
The _Persian_ tobacco is what they use in this instrument, which has
an agreeable flavour; attended with this further advantage, that, when
smoked in this way, neither the taste or smell of it remain after washing
the mouth.

The vulgar, in imitation of their superiors, have at the coffee-houses an
ordinary instrument of the same construction: in this they use the common
tobacco, wetted a little with dibbs and water, or an infusion of raisins,
adding at times _sheera_[439], to make it intoxicating; and they will
draw in such vast quantities of smoke, that when they throw it out again
at the mouth and nostrils, it appears surprising where they found room to
contain it.

Opium is not of so high esteem with the inhabitants of _Aleppo_ as at
_Constantinople_, and some other places; nor could I ever find the taking
it so general a practice in _Turky_ as is commonly apprehended, being
chiefly practised only by debauchees. They who take it to excess are
commonly stiled _teriaky_; and the _Theriac. Andromach._ is called in
_Turkish_ _teriack_, which perhaps may countenance a conjecture that this
was the original form they used it in. At present they not only use it in
that form, but have various other electuaries or confections wherein it
is mixed with aromatics. Some few use it pure; and the greatest quantity
I ever knew taken was three drachms in twenty-four hours. The immediate
effects that I observed it to have upon such as were addicted to it
was, that their spirits were exhilarated, and, from a dosing, depressed
state which they fell into after passing the usual time of taking their
dose, they became quite alert. The consequences of a long use of it are,
that they soon look old and besotted, like such as in _Europe_ have
ruined their constitutions by hard drinking. And it may be considered as
point of fact, that they but seldom live to a good old age: though they
are rarely carried off by dropsies, or such other diseases, the usual
consequences of hard drinking amongst us; but rather having first lost
their memory, and most of their intellectual faculties, they decline, in
all appearance, in the same way as those who sink under the weight of
years.

In _Aleppo_ there are a number of public bagnios, which are frequented by
people of all sects and conditions, except those of a very high rank, who
have mostly baths in their own houses. The first entrance in the public
bagnio is a large, lofty room; in the middle of which is a fountain,
with a bason, which serves for washing the linen, that hangs upon lines
at a considerable height all over the room. In this first apartment are
broad benches, where they dress and undress; and the air is here not at
all influenced by the heat of the bath, except it be just at the door, by
which you pass into a small room, which is pretty warm, and from thence
into a larger very hot. About the sides of these two rooms are placed
round stone-basons, of about two feet and a half diameter, with two
cocks, one of hot, and the other of cold water; so that you may temper
it according to your own pleasure, and there are copper-bowls for you
to lave it upon your body. In the corners of the inner room there are
small retiring-chambers; in one of which there is frequently a cistern of
warm water, about four feet deep, and large enough for bathing the whole
body. All these rooms are surmounted by cupolas; and the inner receive
their light from small openings in their domes, which are covered with
glasses. The outer room receives its light, not only from the lanthorn
of its dome, but also from windows. Some few bagnios are solely for the
men, others are appropriated to the women only; yet the generality of
them admit both sexes, though at different times; that is, the men in the
forenoon, and women in the afternoon.

When a man goes into the hot room, the first thing he does is to apply
the _dewa_[440], (or medicine for taking off the hair), to the pubis and
armpits. This is suffered to remain till the hair is quite loose, and
then must be immediately washed clean away with great care. After this,
one of the servants of the bagnio begins with chaffing, or kneading
violently, first the tops of the shoulders, and then by degrees the whole
body. When he comes to the hand, he pulls the joints of the fingers, so
as to make each crack separately; then laying the person on his back,
with his arms across his breast, he raises him forcibly by the back part
of the neck, so as to make the greatest part of the vertebræ crack. He
then chaffs the back a little more, and, throwing a quantity of warm
water over the whole body, rubs him hard with a bag made of a fort of
coarse camelot, which is drawn over the servant’s hand, for some time. He
is next rubbed over with a soap-lather; and the whole being washed clean
off, he puts one towel round his middle, another round his head, and
perhaps a third over his shoulders; in which manner he goes out to the
great room, where he generally smokes a pipe, drinks coffee, and perhaps
eats some fruit, before he dresses.

The women having the additional trouble of combing and washing, as well
as unplaiting and plaiting their hair, besides very frequently that of
a number of children to wash, remain generally in the hot room for a
considerable time; but refresh themselves at intervals, by going out into
the other rooms, where they smoke, converse, and drink coffee, with one
or other of the various parties that are commonly there. Every company of
two or three are attended by an old woman, whose business it is to rub
and wash them; but do not chaff and crack their joints as the men, and
their bag for rubbing is much finer. They also use the _dewa_.

Each company, generally speaking, has its collation, which they eat in
the middle room before dressing: and as the bagnio is the principal place
where they have an opportunity of showing their fine cloaths, seeing a
number of company, or enjoying the freedom of conversation, though with
their own sex only, it is not to be wondered that they are very fond of
it, though their entertainment may not be so elegant as _Europeans_ might
expect.

The first time a woman of the country (whether _Christian_, _Turk_, or
_Jew_) goes to the bagnio after child-bearing, she must have what they
call the _shdood_; which is thus performed. She is set down in one of
the washing-places of the inner room, and the midwife rubs her over with
a composition of ginger, pepper, nutmegs, and other spices, made into
a sort of ointment, or rather electuary, with honey. In this manner
she sits for some time, the other women in the mean while singing and
warbling with their voices in a particular tone, which is their usual way
of rejoicing in this country. After this the lady is washed clean, and
the ceremony finished. This they imagine strengthens them, and prevents a
great many disorders that would otherwise ensue after delivery; and they
use it also after recovery from any very severe fit of sickness.

The people here have no notion of the benefit of exercise, either for the
preservation of health, or curing diseases; and it is with reluctance
that they use much, either for business or pleasure. To walk or ride
to the gardens once or twice a-week at the proper seasons, is as much
as most of them do for the last mentioned purpose; and the other is
different, according to the nature of their employments.

The people of condition, and their dependents, should however be excepted
in some instances, they being commonly very active on horseback, and in
sporting, or the _jareed_[441], using very violent exercise. This however
is but seldom, and hardly compensates for the time they spend in that
indolent indulgence, of lolling on their divans, which is the way the
generality pass much the greatest part of their time.

As they have no coaches, persons of condition ride on horseback in the
city, with a number of servants walking before them, according to their
rank; which, though it may not be so convenient in bad weather, has
certainly a more manly, if not a grander appearance, than our coaches.
The ladies, even of the greatest figure, are obliged to walk on foot,
both in the city, and when they go to any garden, if it is but at a
moderate distance. In longer journies, the women of rank are carried by
mules in a litter, close covered up; and those of inferior condition on
these occasions are commonly stowed one on each side of a mule, in a sort
of covered cradles.

Most of the natives go to bed in good time, and rise early in the
morning. They sleep in their drawers, and at least one or two
waistcoats, and some of them in winter in their furs. Their bed consists
of a matrass laid on the floor, and over this a sheet (in winter a
carpet, or some such woollen covering), the other sheet being sowed to
the quilt. A divan-cushion often serves for a bolster and pillow; though
some have a bolster and pillow as we have. When the time for repose draws
nigh, they sit down on this matrass, and smoke their pipe, till they find
themselves sleepy; then they lay themselves down, and leave their women
or servants to cover them when asleep; and many of the people of fashion
are lulled to rest by soft music, or stories told out of the _Arabian
Nights Entertainment_, or some other book of the same kind, which their
women are taught to repeat for this purpose. If they happen to wake in
the night, they sit up, fill their pipe, have a dish of coffee made, and
sometimes, especially in the long winter-nights, eat some of their sweet
pastry, and so sit till they drop asleep again. In the summer their beds
are made in their court-yard, or on the house-top; in the winter they
chuse for their bed-chamber the smallest and lowest-roofed room on the
ground-floor. There is always a lamp burning, and often one or two pans
of charcoal; which sometimes proves of bad consequence even to them, and
would certainly suffocate such as have not been accustomed to this bad
practice.

The coffee-houses are only frequented by the vulgar. The masters of these
houses have often, for the entertainment of their customers, a concert
of music, a story-teller, and, in time of _Ramadan_ particularly, an
obscene, low kind of puppet-show, and sometimes tumblers and jugglers;
and these, properly speaking, are all their public diversions.

Their amusements within doors are playing at chess, in which they are
very expert, and a fort of backgammon, both borrowed from the _Persians_;
draughts, mankala, tabuduk, and the play of the ring, as they call
it, which is what the great men often amuse themselves with in the
winter-evenings. It consists merely in guessing what coffee-cup, out of
a number that are placed on a large salver, the ring is hid under. They
have several engaged in the play on each side; and the parties that win
have the privilege of blacking the faces of their antagonists, putting
fools caps on their heads, and making them stand before them while they
sing _extempore_ songs in their own praise, and in derision of the
losers. But it is only their servants, or ordinary people, that they
treat in this manner; and some of these, especially if they have any turn
to buffoonry, are always of the party on purpose.

Though some Christians have learned of the _Europeans_ to play for money;
yet these games are only used by the _Turks_ for amusement, and chiefly
to pass the long winter-evenings. Sometimes, ’tis true, they will go so
far as to play for an entertainment.

Dancing is not, as in _Europe_, reckoned an accomplishment for people
of fashion, and is scarce practised, even among the vulgar, but by such
as make a trade of it. Their dexterity does not consist in agility,
but chiefly in the motion of the arms and body, putting themselves in
different attitudes, many of which (particularly of the women) are none
of the most decent. Their manner is not ill described by _Juvenal_[442].

At their festivals they have also wrestlers as a part of their
entertainment. They have still a resemblance to the _athletæ_ of the
ancients, in anointing their naked bodies, having nothing on but a pair
of breeches, and strut and vaunt so much at their entry as seems to
promise great matters; but they make but very sorry figures in their
performance.

I should not omit among their amusements to mention buffoons, who are the
constant attendants at all merry-makings, and without whom their mirth
and conversation would soon languish, or conclude.

The music of the country is of two sorts; one for the field, the other
for the chamber. The first makes part of the retinue of the _bashaws_,
and other great military officers, and is used also in their garrisons.
It consists of a sort of hautboy[443], shorter, but shriller than ours;
trumpets[444], cymbals[445], large drums[446], the upper head of which
is beat upon with a heavy drum-stick, the lower with a small switch. A
_vizir-bashaw_ has nine of these large drums, while a _bashaw of two
tails_ has but eight, the distinction by which the music of one may be
known from that of the other. Besides these, they have small drums[447],
beat after the manner of our kettle-drums. This music at a distance has a
tolerable good effect.

Their chamber-music consists of a dulcimer[448], guittar[449], dervises
flute[450], blown in a very particular manner; _Arab_ fiddle[451],
a couple of small drums, and the diff[452], which serves chiefly to
beat time to the voice, the worst of all their music; for they bellow
so hideously, that it spoils what without it would be in some degree
harmonious. This diff is a hoop, (sometimes with pieces of brass fixed in
it to make a jingling) over which a piece of parchment is distended. It
is beat with the fingers, and is the true tympanum of the ancients; as
appears from its figure in several relievos, representing the orgies of
_Bacchus_, and rites of _Cybele_. It is worth observing, that, according
to _Juvenal_, the _Romans_ had this instrument first from hence[453].
They also have a kind of flute, like the ancient _syrinx_; but it is not
much used among them, there being but few that can play upon it.

Besides the above mentioned instruments, they have likewise a sort of
bagpipe, which numbers of idle fellows play upon round the skirts of the
town, making it a pretence to ask a present of such as pass.

Though they understand the different measures in music, and have names
for them; yet they have no method of writing the notes. They learn
entirely by the ear; yet it is observable, that when several persons play
together they keep time very exactly. They have neither bass, nor other
different parts in music, all playing the same.

The print annexed represents a _Turkish_ concert, drawn from the life;
in which care has been taken also to show, through a window, the inner
court-yard of a house, with the little garden, fountain, _&c._ and
through another is seen part of a mosque, with the minaret, from whence
the _imaums_ call the people to prayers. The dress of the performers also
show the different kinds wore by the ordinary people, according to their
sect, _&c._ The first, who beats the diff, represents that of an ordinary
_Turk_; the next a slovenly ordinary Christian; the middle figure is a
Dervise; the fourth is a Christian of a middle rank, playing upon the
_Arab_ fiddle. What is peculiar in his dress, is, that the sash of the
turbant is strip’d with, blue, and his slippers red. The last is an
ordinary fellow, beating the small drums with his fingers, as they often
do, instead of drumsticks. His head-dress is such as is worn by many
_Janizaries_, and commonly by the _Arabgarlees_, a race of _Armenians_,
who attend upon the _Europeans_.

Whatever figure the inhabitants of this country made formerly in
literature, they are at present very ignorant. Many _bashaws_, and even
farmers of the customs, and considerable merchants, cannot either read or
write. It must be observed, however, that their youth of late years are
better taught than formerly; though, even at this time, their education
seldom extends farther than just to read a little of the Koran, and
write a common letter, except such as are bred to the law or divinity,
which are closely allied in this country. The professors of both usually
pretend likewise to some skill in physic. In the time I lived there,
only one inhabitant of the place understood enough of astronomy to be
able to calculate the time of an eclipse; for which he was looked upon
as a very extraordinary person. Numbers there are who imagine they
understand judicial astrology, in which the natives have great faith: but
it would take up too much time even so much as to mention their various
superstitions in this and many other respects.

In the city there are a great number of colleges, but very little taught
in them; they being generally built by such as have raised great estates
by oppression, and other bad means, and are intended by the founders,
partly as an atonement for their wickedness, and partly to secure an
estate in the family, their descendents being commonly appointed curators
of these endowments, and seldom fail to apply to their own private use
what seemed intended for public benefit; and thus the school soon runs to
decay. Many of these have a sort of library belonging to them, and a few
private men among the learned have some books; but these are very rarely
good for much, and are kept more through vanity, than for any use they
either make of them themselves, or suffer to be made of them by others.

Though the _Turks_ are predestinarians, they are taught however to
believe, that tho’ God has afflicted mankind with diseases; yet he has
sent them also the remedies, and they are therefore to use the proper
means for their recovery: so that practitioners in physic are here well
esteemed, and very numerous. These are chiefly native Christians, and a
few _Jews_. The _Turks_ seldom make this their profession. Not one of the
natives, however, of any sect is allowed to practise without a licence
from the _Hakeem Bashee_; but a few sequins are sufficient to procure
this to the most ignorant; and such most of them are egregiously, for
they have no colleges in which any branch of physic is taught: and as the
present constitution of their government renders the dissection of human
bodies impracticable, and that of brutes is a thing of which they never
think, they have a very imperfect idea of the situation of the parts, or
their functions.

Of the use of chemistry in medicine they are totally ignorant; but now
and then one amongst them just acquires a smattering enough of alchemy to
beggar his family by it.

Many of them are brought up under masters who live by the profession
of physic; but these are seldom capable of teaching them much; and, to
conceal their own ignorance the more effectually, they commonly pretend
to a number of secrets not to be disclosed: so that such of them as know
any thing, must obtain it by their own reading and observation. But to
the latter they are seldom much indebted, as they look upon whatever
they find in any book as an established fact, and not to be by them
contradicted, however opposite it may appear to their own experience.

The books they have amongst them are some of the _Arabian_ writers;
_Ebensina_ in particular, whose authority is indisputable with them. They
have likewise some translations of _Hippocrates_, _Galen_, _Dioscorides_,
and a few other ancient _Greek_ writers. But their copies are in general
miserably incorrect. Hence it may easily be seen, that the state
of physic among the natives in this country, as well as every other
science, is at a very low ebb, and that it is far from being in a way of
improvement.

But, ignorant as they are in regard to physic, they are great matters in
temporising, and know how to suit a plausible theory to the patient’s way
of thinking; in doing which they scruple not to quote the authority of
_Hippocrates_, _Galen_, and _Ebensina_, in support of opinions the most
ridiculous and absurd.

It is from the pulse alone that they pretend, and are expected to
discover all diseases, and also pregnancy: from their confidence in
which last they are daily the death of numbers of infants, by persuading
the women that their complaints are from obstructions, and giving them
medicines accordingly; while many others, under real diseases, are amused
with the hopes of pregnancy till past recovery.

Their practice is very trifling in most cases, and commonly adapted
rather to suit the opinion of the sick, and those about them, than the
cure of the disease. While they apprehend the sick to be in no danger,
they attend close, and give quantities of medicines; but, as soon as
they think they are in danger, they do not go near them unless sent for,
and then give no medicines, but advise the relations to use some trifling
things; for which indeed they have some reason, for commonly the last
medicine taken is held to be the cause of the patient’s death.

What has been said with regard to practitioners in physic, relates solely
to the natives; for the _Europeans_, of whom there are several, practise
in their own way, and are greatly respected by the inhabitants; though,
partly to save their money, and partly from a notion of their giving
violent medicines, they seldom apply to them, till they have tried their
own doctors to no purpose.

Though their bards are the last mentioned, yet they are far from being
the least worthy of notice; for at times a poetical genius shows himself
among them, and produces some things which they greatly esteem.

_Miller del. et sc._]

A particular description of their dress, as it would be foreign to my
purpose, so it would carry me beyond my proposed limits. Some tolerable
idea of it may be gathered from Plate XIV. XV. and XVI.[454]. All that
I shall say, therefore, on this head is, that, notwithstanding their
peculiar attachment to ancient customs, they are of late become not a
little extravagant in this article. And though their fashions do not
alter so quick as in _Europe_, yet they do alter, and that not seldom.
Such of their singularities, however, in respect to dress and ornament,
as seem more immediately to regard their health, it may be proper to
mention.

Some of the old men dye their beards, and the old women their hair, of a
red colour, with henna, which gives them a very whimsical appearance; and
many of the men dye their beards black, to conceal their age[455].

Few of the women paint, except among the _Jews_, and such as are common
prostitutes; but they generally black their eye-brows, or rather
make artificial ones, with a certain composition which they call
_hattat_[456]. This practice, however, is daily declining.

Upon a principle of strengthening the sight, as well as an ornament, it
is become a general practice among the women, to black the inside of
their eye-lids, by applying a powder called _ismed_[457]. Their method
of doing it is by a cylindrical piece of silver, steel, or ivory,
about two inches long, made very smooth, and about the size of a common
probe. This they wet with water, in order that the powder may stick to
it; and applying the middle part horizontally to the eye, they shut the
eye-lids upon it, and so drawing it through between them, it blacks the
inside, leaving a narrow black rim all round the edge. This is sometimes
practised by the men, but is then regarded as foppish.

Another singular method of adorning themselves the women have, which
is, by dying their feet and hands with henna; which is brought in great
quantities from _Egypt_, chiefly for that purpose, as the practice is
general amongst all sects and conditions. The common way is only to dye
the tips of the fingers and toes, and some few spots upon the hands and
feet, and leave them of a dirty yellow colour, the natural tincture from
the henna, which to a _European_ looks very disagreeable. But the more
polite manner is to have the greatest part of the hands and feet stained
in form of roses, and various figures, and the dye made of a very dark
green[458]. This however, after some days, begins to change, and at last
looks as nasty as the other.

The women in some of the villages, and all the _Arabs_ and
_Chinganas_[459], wear a large silver or gold ring through the external
cartilage of their right nostril. I have seen some of at least an inch
and an half diameter. It is usual for these people likewise, by way of
ornament, to mark their under-lip, and sometimes their breasts and arms
with a blue colour. This is done by pricking the part all over with
a needle, and then rubbing it with a certain powder, which leaves a
distinct and indelible mark, like that which one so often sees among the
sailors and common people in _England_.

With respect to the people in general, these remarks may be sufficient.
But as, in their manner of living, the _Turks_ differ from the
Christians, and the _Jews_ from both, it may not be improper to take a
view of each.

To begin with the _Turks_, who are the most numerous; such as can afford,
and dare show it, live well, and are far from being the abstemious people
that many imagine them to be. As soon as they get up in the morning, they
breakfast on fried eggs, cheese, honey, leban, _&c._ About eleven o’clock
in the forenoon in winter, and rather earlier in summer, they dine.
Their table is round, and as well as their dishes, is made either of
copper tinned, or for _bashaws_, and other persons of high distinction,
of silver. It is placed upon a stool about a foot or fourteen inches
high. A piece of red cloth, cut in a round form, is spread upon the divan
under the table, to prevent that from being soiled; and a long piece
of silk-stuff is laid round, to cover the knees of such as sit at the
table, which has no covering but the victuals. Pickles, sallads, small
basons of leban, bread, and spoons, are disposed in proper order round
the edges. The middle is for the dishes, which (among the great people)
are brought in one by one; and, after each person has ate a little,
they are changed. Their fingers serve them for knives and forks; but
for liquids they are obliged to have spoons, which are made of wood,
horn, or tortoise-shell, for silver or gold is not permitted them for
that purpose by their religion. The first dish is generally a sort of
broth, or soup[460], and the last pilaw. The intermediate dishes, which,
generally speaking, are numerous, consist of mutton cut into small
pieces, and roasted[461], or stewed with herbs and cicers[462]; stewed
pigeons, fowls, or other birds, which are commonly stuffed with rice and
spices. A whole lamb, stuffed with rice, almonds, raisins, pistaches,
_&c._ and stewed, is a favourite dish with them[463]. Rice, and minced
meat, wrapped up in vine-leaves[464], beet, endive, borrage, _&c._
or stuffed into cucumbers[465], mad apples[466] (badinjans), gourds,
quinces, _&c._ and stewed, they are very fond of, and call _mahshee_,
in _Turkish_ _dolmah_, with the name of the enveloping vegetable added,
as _badinjan mahshee_, &c. Pastry, both with meat, and of the sweet or
fruit kind, they would make very well, if the badness of their butter did
not spoil them. A large pilaw, with a dish of sweet starch[467], which
they sometimes eat with it, comes last, excepting the _khushaf_; which
is a very thin syrup, with currans, raisins, dried apricots, pistaches,
slices of pears, apples, or the like, swimming in it; and of this each
person takes a large spoonful, with spoons brought in with it on purpose,
and finishes the repast. Water is their liquor at table, and after dinner
they drink coffee. Almost all their dishes are either greasy with fat, or
butter pretty high-seasoned with salt and spices; many of them made sour
with verjuice, pomegranate, or lemon-juice; and onions and garlick often
complete the seasoning.

They sup early, that is, about five o’clock in the winter, and six in
the summer, in much the same manner that they dine; and in winter, as
they often visit one another, and sit up late, they have a collation of
_kennafy_[468], or other sweet dishes.

In the summer their breakfast commonly consists of fruits; and, besides
dinner and supper, they often, within the compass of the day, eat
water-melons, cucumbers, and other fruits, according to the season.

It is to be observed, that they are not so regular in their times of
eating as the _Europeans_: and though it should happen that they are but
just rose from table, they cannot withstand the invitation of another
company, but sit down and eat again with them.

The common people have no such variety as has been before described.
Bread, dibbs, leban, butter, rice, and a very little mutton, make the
chief of their food in the winter; as rice, bread, cheese, and fruits, do
in the summer. Their principal meal is in the evening, when they return
to their families from the exercise of their respective occupations.

Through the whole of the month of _Ramadan_[469], they fast from the dawn
of day till sunset, and do not either eat or smoke: but, as soon as the
sun is down, they eat a hearty meal; and, such as can afford to sleep in
the day, keep eating and drinking the greatest part of the night, living
more luxuriously than at other times, and generally spending as much
money in that one, as in any other two months in the year: but the poor
labourers, or those whose business calls them abroad in the day, suffer
a great deal during this fast, more especially when it happens in the
summer.

Though wine and spirits are only drank by the irreligious and licentious
among the _Turks_, yet the number of these is more than what from
appearance one would apprehend: for as these liquors are prohibited
by their religion, they chiefly drink in secret at their gardens, or
privately in the night; and, if they once begin, they generally drink to
great excess whenever they can come at liquor.

By their religion they are obliged to wash before their prayers, which
are five times in the twenty-four hours[470], and also every time they
ease nature. As they eat chiefly with their fingers, they are likewise
under a necessity to wash after every meal, and the more cleanly do it
before meals also. Besides, every time they cohabit with their women,
they must go to the bagnio before they can say their prayers; so that
they are almost all day long dabbling in water.

Though by law, or rather from an implied toleration[471], they
are allowed four wives, and as many concubines, or more properly
female-slaves, as they can or care to maintain; yet as they are obliged
to pay money for their wives, few of any rank have more than two; the
poorer sort have seldom more than one, and hardly ever a concubine. Those
of middling circumstances rarely exceed three or four; though some I have
known, of greater opulence, have kept forty, exclusive of those employed
in the menial offices of the family. It may appear strange how such a
number should agree tolerably well together; and in fact the master of
the family hath very frequently enough to do to keep the peace among
them. But if we consider, that they are accustomed from their infancy to
a servile obedience, that the husband can at pleasure divorce his wife
without assigning any cause, and sell such of his slaves as he has had no
children by, it will not appear so extraordinary that they live together
in a tolerable degree of harmony. On the other hand, the wife has also a
check upon him; for if he divorces his wife, it is attended with expence,
as he must not only lose all the money she at first cost him, but there
is generally a sum equal to that stipulated by the contract, to be paid
in case he should at any time divorce her.

In this country marriages are commonly brought about by the ladies: and
the mothers, in order to find out a proper wife for their sons, take all
opportunities of introducing themselves into company where they expect to
have a sight of a young woman who may be disengaged; and, when they have
met with one they think will be agreeable, they propose to the mother a
match between her and the young man. This puts the family upon enquiring
into his character and circumstances; and, if matters are likely to be
adjusted, she is formally demanded of her parents by the father, the
price is fixed that he is to pay for her, and a licence is procured from
the _kadè_, for such a person to marry such a woman: each of the young
folks then appoint a proxy, who meet with the _imaum_, and several of the
male relations; and, after witnesses have been examined to prove those
are the proxies regularly appointed, he asks the one, If he is willing to
buy the bride for such a sum of money? and the other, If he is satisfied
with the sum? To which having received answers in the affirmative, he
joins their hands; and the money being paid, the bargain is concluded
with a prayer out of the Koran.

The bridegroom is at liberty after this to take his bride home whenever
he thinks proper; and the day being fixed, he sends a message to her
family, acquainting them with it. The money which he paid for her, is
laid out in furniture for one chamber, and cloaths and jewels, or gold
ornaments for the bride, whose father makes some addition, according to
his circumstances, which are sent with great pomp to the bridegroom’s
house three days before the wedding. He invites, at the same time, all
his friends and acquaintance, and, if a man in power, a great many
others, for all who are invited send presents, whether they think proper
to go or not. Rejoicings are made, and a sort of open house, is kept for
several days preceding the wedding. The women, on the day appointed, go
from the bridegroom’s to the bride’s house, and bring her home to his,
accompanied by her mother, and other female relations, where each sex
make merry in separate apartments till night. The men then dress the
bridegroom, and give notice to the women; upon which he is introduced
into the court-yard of the womens apartment, and there met by his own
female relations, who dance and sing before him to the stair’s foot of
the bride’s apartment, who is brought half way down stairs to receive
him, being veil’d with a piece of red gause, and often, if young,
especially her forehead and cheeks covered with leaf-gold, cut into
various forms. When he has conducted her up stairs, they are left to
themselves[472].

They have a few black slaves, which are commonly brought from _Æthiopia_,
by way of _Cairo_; but the greater part of their slaves are white, being
mostly furnished from _Georgia_, or such as are taken in war; and the
beauty of a male-slave enhances the value as much as it does that of
a female, occasioned by the frequency among them of a crime not to be
named. When I mention their slaves, it will not be amiss to observe, that
they are generally very well treated, and, provided they behave as they
ought, very often marry their masters daughters, and inherit their whole
fortunes.

The _Turks_ of _Aleppo_ being very jealous, keep their women as much at
home as they can; so that it is but seldom they are allowed to visit each
other. Necessity however obliges the husband to suffer them to go often
to the bagnio, and _Mondays_ and _Thursdays_ are a sort of licenced days
for them to visit the tombs of their deceased relations; which furnishing
them with an opportunity of walking abroad in the gardens or fields, they
have so contrived, that almost every _Thursday_ in the spring bears the
name of some particular _sheih_[473], whose tomb they must visit on that
day. By this means the greatest part of the _Turkish_ women of the city
get abroad to breathe the fresh air at such seasons, unless confined
(as is not uncommon) to their houses by order of the _bashaw_, and so
deprived even of that little freedom which custom had procured them
from their husbands. When the women go abroad, they wear white veils,
so managed that nothing appears but their eyes, and a small part of the
nose. They are usually in large companies, and have always either an old
woman or a young lad for a guard.

The _haram_, or women’s apartment, among the people of fashion, is
guarded by a black eunuch, or young boy. And though necessity obliges
many of the inferior people to trust their wives out of doors, yet some
are locked up till the husbands return; so that the utmost care in that
way is taken among them to prevent a breach of the marriage-vow. But
where there are no ties of love or virtue, one may easily conceive that
others prove ineffectual; and how far affection has place among them,
may be guessed from what has been already mentioned in regard to choice:
or at least when to this is added, that it is a kind of reproach among
them to be thought fond of their women, or to shew them much tenderness
or respect; the best of them being only treated as upper servants, and
often abused and drove about by the very eunuchs or boys bought or hired
to look after them.

When a _Turk_ dies, the women immediately fall a shrieking, (a practice
followed by all the natives) and continue so to do till the body is
buried; which however is dispatched as soon as possible, for they never
keep it longer than is absolutely necessary for acquainting the relations
who live in town. The first thing done is to wash the corpse upon a large
table, which every _hara_[474] has for this purpose: they next stop all
the natural passages with cotton, to prevent any moisture from oozing
out, as this would render the body unclean; then wrapping it up in a
clean cotton-cloth, they lay it in a kind of coffin, much in the form
of ours, only that the lid rises with a ledge in the middle, and at the
head there is a wooden battoon, about a foot long, that stands up, on
which the proper head-dress of the deceased is placed, if a man; but if
a woman, it is not her head-dress, but an old-fashioned one, flat on top
like a trencher, and over it is thrown a handkerchief. The middle part of
the pall is composed of a small piece of the old covering of the holy
house at _Mecca_, the rest of it being of no particular colour or stuff.
Over the pall are laid some of the deceased’s best cloaths.

When the corpse is carried out, a number of _sheihs_, with their tattered
banners, walk first, next come the male-friends, and after them the
corpse, carried with the head foremost, upon mens shoulders. The bearers
are relieved very often, for every passenger thinks it meritorious
to lend some little help on such solemn occasions. The nearest
male-relations immediately follow, and the women close the procession
with dreadful shrieks, while the men all the way are singing prayers out
of the Koran. Thus they proceed to a mosque; where the bier is set down
in the court-yard, and a service said by the _imaum_: after which it is
carried on in the same order as before to the burying-place; of which
there is but one that is public within the city, the others being all
abroad in the fields.

The graves lie east and west, and are lined with stone. The corpse is
taken out of the bier, and put in a posture between sitting and lying on
the right-side, with the head to the westward, so that the face may be to
the south, that is, towards _Mecca_; a small portion of earth being put
behind the body to keep it steady, the grave is covered with long stones,
which go across, and prevent the earth they put over from falling in
upon the corpse. The _imaum_ throws on the first handful of earth,
saying at the same time a prayer for the soul of the deceased[475], and
exhorting such as hear him to be mindful of their end. After him every
one present throws also a handful of earth, saying, God be merciful unto
the deceased person. This done, the grave is filled up. At each end
of their graves is set up a stone, upon which are commonly wrote some
prayers, and the name of the person there interred. Some have the upper
part of the head-stone cut into the form of turbant for a man, or an
old-fashioned sort of head-dress if a woman; and as they never open the
old graves in less than seven years, or seldom so soon, their cemetaries
occupy a very considerable space round the city.

The nearest relations go to pray at the grave on the third, seventh,
and fortieth days, as also that day twelve-month, after the person’s
decease; and on every one of those days a quantity of victuals is
dressed, and given to the poor. The women go to the tomb every _Monday_
or _Thursday_, and carry some flowers or green leaves to dress it with.
They make a great shew of grief, often expostulating heavily with the
dead person, “Why he should leave them, when they had done every thing
in their power to make life agreeable to him?” This, however, by the men
is looked upon as a kind of impiety; and, if over-heard, they are chid
severely for it: and I must say the men generally set them a good example
in this respect, by a patient acquiescence in the loss of their nearest
relations, and indeed shew a firm and steady fortitude under every other
kind of misfortune.

The men wear no mourning; but the women put on their gravest-coloured
cloaths, and the head-dress is of a dark brick-dust colour. They also
lay aside their jewels, and other pieces of female finery, for the
space of twelve months, if they mourn for their husband, and six months
if for their father. These periods, however, they do not observe very
strictly. But before the widow marries again, she must mourn forty days
for her deceased husband, without going out of the house, or speaking to
any person more than what is absolutely necessary; and this prohibition
extends even to her nearest relations. This term of forty days does
not commence from the demise or burial; but, on the contrary, is rarely
observed till several months after.

It would not only be foreign to my present purpose, but also superfluous,
to mention any thing particular, either in respect to their religion or
government, especially as the reader may have recourse to such pieces
as expressly treat of these subjects. I shall only say in regard to the
first, that they are very exact observers of their times of prayer, and
other exterior forms; but practise very little the other duties enjoined
by it, if you except giving alms to the poor, (of whom there are great
numbers in _Aleppo_) and hospitality to strangers; which last they
practise in a very eminent degree. I remember once, in conversation with
the _muftee_, who is a jocose old man, he told me that he had a favour
to beg of me, which was, that, when I returned to _England_, I would not
misrepresent the _Mohammedan_ faith, by giving an account of it from what
I had seen in the practice of the _Moslems_. But, says he, if you will
take just the reverse of what you see daily practised by us, you will be
pretty near the truth. I shall not however take the liberty to say that
they are quite so bad as he represented them.

Their military governors, as _vizir-bashaws_, &c. are not now composed
of slaves, or sons of Christians, as they were formerly; but are either
favourites of the _Grand Signor_, or such as will purchase their places
at the highest rate, for the best bidder generally carries it; and
as they pay large sums to the _Port_, and the legal income of their
government is not sufficient for a quarter of their expences, they are
suffered to fleece the people: and though they make some false pretence
for it, and often have the cause formally tried before the _kady_; yet
the veil is so thin, that it evidently appears, that _sic volo sic
jubeo_ is the only plea for seizing a man’s whole fortune, and sometimes
depriving him of life also. However, they are far from being so cruel as
they were formerly.

As to their civil magistrates, or _kadys_, money goes a great way with
them in their determination of lawsuits, and witnesses may be always had
for a trifle to prove any thing that is desired. However, there is one
good thing, that ought not to be forgot, which is, their quick decision
of the causes that come before them. It ought likewise to be mentioned in
their praise, that they will commonly accept of less money to determine a
suit in favour of the person who has right on his side, than of him who
is in the wrong. The expence of a suit, which is 10 _per cent._ upon the
sum demanded, is paid to the judge by the person who carries his cause;
which is one great encouragement to bad men to make false demands on such
as they are at enmity with, as it costs them nothing, and the innocent
man must pay, and that too in proportion to the weight of the injury
intended him. Some _kadys_, however, when the thing is very apparent,
accept of a smaller sum than they are intitled to; but the false accuser
is never punished.

The common punishment for slight offences is beating the soles of the
feet with small sticks; and sometimes, when they would punish more
severely, they beat also the back and buttocks; which last is the way in
which they chastise the _Janizaries_ and women.

For capital crimes, if the offender is a _Janizary_, he is strangled;
not in the way generally imagined, but by putting a cord twice round
their neck, and with a piece of stick twisting it in the nature of a
tournequet. Other criminals are hanged, beheaded, or impaled, according
to the caprice of the _bashaw_. After all their executions, the body
remains exposed for at least three suns.

It is a mistaken notion, that such as have been at _Mecca_ may commit
crimes with impunity, since, according to their law, they cannot be put
to death. Their being _hadgys_ doth not intitle them to any privilege
of that nature; and, even on the road to and from _Mecca_, such of the
pilgrims as commit crimes are punished as in other places; there being
not only a _bashaw_, but a _kady_, in the caravan on purpose to try them;
and numbers are executed every year on their journey, as well returning
as on the road thither.

The _Emeers_, or relations of _Mohammed_, distinguished by a green sash
round their heads, instead of the white wore by the other _Moslems_,
have indeed a privilege of being tried and punished by the _Nakeeb_,
an _Effendy_ appointed on purpose to preside over them. However, the
_bashaws_, when they please, break through this custom. They have a
much greater benefit, by their being exempted from paying any part of
the expences of the city; which, since the great decrease of trade from
the disturbances in _Persia_, and the ruin of many of the villages by
their own bad government, falls very heavy upon the people; for they
are daily less able to pay, and the demands of the governors rather
encrease. The Christians, by the contentions between such as have become
_Roman Catholics_, and others that remain of the old churches, furnish
the governors with numerous pretences of extorting large sums of money
from them; so that it is not extraordinary that their ruin should be the
farthest advanced.

The Christians, except in their Lent or fast-days, eat much in the same
manner as the _Turks_; only we must observe, that they do not introduce
either the shorba or pilaw so frequently at their tables. They eat more
_burgle_[476], and less rice, and frequently use oil where the _Turks_
use butter. The _Turkish_ _hushaf_ is supplied by wine or spirits; of
which many of them drink pretty liberally.

On their fast-days, the number of which is very considerable[477], their
chief subsistence is a few pot-herbs, roots, and pulse, dressed with
oil, which is seldom good. Fish is not always to be had, nor allowed by
the greatest part of them in their great Lent before _Easter_. Pickled
green olives, or black (ripe) ones salted, make a considerable part of
their food at such times.

In keeping their fasts, they are generally very exact, or rather
rigorous. However, if a physician declares their life to be in danger,
the _Greeks_, _Syrians_, and _Maronites_, will often break their fast;
but the _Armenians_ are for the most part so very strict, that not even
the preservation of life is sufficient to prevail with them to interrupt
it so much as for a day. Most of them (_Armenians_) in the great Lent do
not so much as eat oil.

The Christian women are as closely veiled, though in a different manner,
as _Turkish_ women are, when they go abroad, which the better sort seldom
do but to church, the bagnio, their physicians, or now and then to visit
a relation. Some few of them permit their wives, perhaps twice or thrice
a-year, to go to the gardens; and others, though the gardens are not a
mile from their house, never saw one in their lives.

Most of them are contracted while children by their parents. There being
nothing very material in the ceremonies of the different sects, I shall
give the description of a _Maronite_ wedding, which will serve as a
specimen of all the rest.

After the bride has been demanded, the relations of the bridegroom are
invited to an entertainment at the house of the bride’s father, in order
to consult with her relations (for the young folks themselves have no
vote in such affairs, nor are ever seen) concerning the proper day for
celebrating the wedding; and it is almost always agreed on for that
day fortnight. On the appointed day, in the afternoon, they again go
to the bride’s house; and, having supped there, return to that of the
bridegroom, who hitherto has not appeared, though some little enquiry has
been made after him; for he is by custom obliged to hide himself, or at
least is not to be found without a seemingly strict search. When he is
brought out, dressed in his worst cloaths, great noise and rejoicings are
then made on the finding him; and he and the bride’s man, after being led
several times round the court yard in a noisy procession, are carried
into a room, where their wedding-cloaths are laid out in form. A priest
says a long prayer over them; and, being dressed, they are led back into
the court-yard with the same ceremony as before.

At midnight, or a few hours later, the relations, accompanied by all
that have been invited to the wedding, men and women, return once more
to the house where the bride is, in procession, each carrying a candle,
and music playing before them. When they come to the door, it is shut
upon them; and when they knock, and demand the bride, they are refused
admittance. Upon this ensues a mock-fight, but the bridegroom’s party
always prevails. The women then go to the bride’s chamber, lead her
out veiled quite over, and in the like procession carry her to the
bridegroom’s; but not more than one or two of her sisters, or nearest
female-relations, must accompany her. She is there set down at the upper
end of the room among the women, continues veiled with a red gause; and
must sit like a statue, neither moving nor speaking on any account,
except rising to every person that comes into the room, which is notified
to her by one of the women who sits by her constantly, for she must
not open her eyes. The rest of the night is spent by each sex in their
separate apartments in noisy mirth, eating fruits and sweet-meats, there
being no want of wine and arrack. Some few retire to rest.

The next day, about nine in the morning, the bishop or priest comes to
perform the ceremony. Before he enters the womens apartment, all the
women are veiled. The bride stands covered entirely, and supported by two
women, the bride’s maid standing by to keep the veil well adjusted. The
bridegroom is dressed in a gaudy robe, and, going in with the bishop, is
placed on the bride’s left-hand, with his bride’s man by him. After a
short service, the bishop puts a crown, first on the bridegroom’s head;
after which the bride, bride’s man and maid, are crowned in the same
manner. He next joins the hands of the bride and bridegroom; and, after
some longer service, puts a ring on the bridegroom’s finger, and delivers
another to the bride’s maid to be put upon that of the bride. Near the
conclusion of the service, he ties round the bridegroom’s neck a piece
of tape or ribbon; to take off which a priest comes in the afternoon.
The ceremony being finished, the bridegroom, and all the men, retire
again to their proper apartment, where they drink coffee, and sit very
gravely while the bishop remains, which is not long; for dinner being
served up immediately for him, and a few select people of the company, he
soon dines, and takes his leave; and he is scarcely gone a few yards from
the house, before their noisy mirth begins. Great quantities of victuals
are dressed, and several tables covered, both for dinner and supper; and
there is usually a profusion of tobacco, coffee, wine, and arrack.

About eleven or twelve at night, the bridegroom is led in procession
to the bride’s chamber, where he presents her with a glass of wine, in
which she drinks to him, and he returns the compliment: after this he is
carried back again with the same ceremony.

The music, during the whole of the time, continues to play, buffoons and
other of their diversions are going forward, and the house is usually
full of company till next day in the afternoon, when they take their
leave, all but a few intimate friends, who sup with the bridegroom, and
about midnight leave him heartily fatigued to retire to the bride’s
chamber.

All those that have been invited to the wedding send presents; and, for
several days after the marriage is consummated, quantities of flowers
are sent to the bride by all the women of their acquaintance.

On that day seven-night the wedding was celebrated, the bride’s relations
are allowed to come and visit her, and an entertainment is provided for
them.

It is not reputed decent, in this country, for a bride to speak to any
person for at least a month (the _Armenians_ extend this to a year),
excepting a few words to her husband; and there is generally a very
strict charge given them by the old women about this, and particularly
not to talk to him too soon.

Few women are allowed to sit at table with their husbands, but wait
upon them as servants; and in general they are not much better treated
than I have described those of the _Turks_ to be. Though they have
no guards upon their apartments, yet the people of fashion are never
suffered to appear unveiled before men, except they are their servants,
near relations, priests, or physicians. The _Maronites_ are the least
strict in this respect; and some of them will appear before particular
strangers, and are even admitted to sit at table with their husbands.
Their confinement, however, does not proceed from jealousy in respect to
their conduct, so much as from the fear of bad consequences, should a
_Turk_ see and take a liking to any of them.

The Christians are carried to the grave on an open bier; and besides many
appointed days, when the relations go to the sepulchre, and have mass
said, and send victuals to the church and poor, many of the women go
every day for the first year, and every great holiday afterwards.

The _Jews_ have their synagogue within the city, in _Bahsyta_, near
_Garden-Gate_, and they live all in that quarter. Many of their houses
are upon the city-wall; and the ditch being there turned into gardens,
makes their situation agreeable, but not so healthy. The houses of other
_Jews_ have their court-yards mostly several feet below the level of the
street; which, with the natural nastiness of the people, contributes
towards rendering their dwellings very offensive.

As most of their time during their festivals is employed in the exercise
of their religion, on the greatest part of them, they cannot dress
victuals; and as it is not lawful for them to eat or drink but of such
things as have been managed in a different way from what they find
among the Christians or _Turks_, they have no great opportunities of
committing excesses; so that they may with justice be pronounced the
most abstemious people in _Aleppo_.

It having been agreed, for the benefit of the poor of this religion, that
meat shall be sold amongst them at an under-price, and the deficiency
made good out of the public stock, the managers take care that their
markets shall be very ill supplied, so that sometimes they are for
several days without a bit of mutton. This is the reason why they eat
more poultry, and the poorer sort chiefly herbs, roots, and pulse,
dressed with oil expressed from the sesamum, than most other people.

Six days[478] in the year they fast from about two hours before sunset,
till the next evening after the sun is down. All of them attempt once in
their lives to fast from _Saturday_ night at sunset, till the _Friday_
following at the same hour. Some hold out two, some three, others four
days, and a few complete it; but there are several who perish in the
attempt.

Except the particular ceremonies which their religion obliges them to
observe, it would be only repeating a great deal of what has been already
said to give an account of their weddings. Amongst the latter, the most
remarkable is, that the bride’s eye-lids are fastened together with gum;
and, if I remember right, the bridegroom is the person that opens them at
an appointed time.

Their dead are carried to the grave on a covered bier. They have certain
days, wherein they go to the sepulchres; and the women, like those of
other sects, often go there to howl and cry over their dead relations.

The _Europeans_, or _Franks_[479] (as they are generally called),
residing in _Aleppo_, are chiefly _English_ and _French_; of the former
at present[480], besides the consul, chaplain, cancellier, or chancellor,
physician, and cheaux[481], there are ten merchants. The _French_ have
a consul, and other officers, as mentioned, and their druggomen[482]
are likewise of their own nation. The number of those in quality of
merchants and clerks is nigh double that of the _English_. Besides which
they have many of a lower class, who are married to natives of the
country, or others of a mixed race: the number of whom in the _Levant_
was become so considerable, and likely to be so troublesome, that the
_French_ King, not many years ago, issued an edict, ordering all such as
were married to return home, and prohibiting any others from marrying
without his licence, which has greatly diminished their number. Under
the _French_ protection are likewise the _Roman Catholic_ convents, of
which there are in the city no less than three[483], and a college of
_Jesuits_. The _Dutch_ have a consul residing here, but no other person
of that country. There are also a few _Venetian_ merchants, and some
_Italian Jews_.

The major part of the _Europeans_ live in _khanes_ in the principal
quarter of the city. The ground-floor serves for their warehouses, the
upper story is fitted up for their dwellings, by building between the
pillars of the colonade, which forms a long corridore; opening on which
are a number of rooms, so that they much resemble cloisters; and as they
are unmarried, and their communication with the people of the country is
almost solely on account of trade, their way of life also not a little
resembles the monastic. It was formerly customary for all, or most of
them, to wear the _Turkish_ habit, retaining only the hat and wig by way
of distinction; but of late years the far greater part have continued in
their proper dress.

The _Italian Jews_, who are mostly married, and such of the _French_
above mentioned as have families, must be excepted, as they have houses
after the manner of the natives, and conform more to their customs than
the other _Europeans_.

As to provisions, it has been already mentioned what the place affords,
and those are dressed after the _European_ manner. The evening being
the chief time of entertaining their friends, they eat more animal food
for supper than is customary in _Britain_. In respect to drink they are
exceeding moderate: their common draught at table is a dry white wine,
and _Provence_ red wine. In summer, the _English_ generally before
dinner and supper drink a draught of weak punch; which is found so very
refreshing, that now the greater part of the other _Europeans_, several
of the Christians (and I might add some _Turks_), follow their example.

All the _English_, and some of the others, keep horses, and ride out
for an hour or two of an afternoon three or four times a-week. On
_Saturdays_, and often on _Wednesday_ likewise, they dine abroad under a
tent in the spring and autumn, and during the good weather in the winter;
the month of _April_, and part of _May_, they generally live at the
gardens near _Baballah_; and in the heat of summer, in the room of the
tent, they dine at the gardens. Such as love hunting or hawking, usually
go abroad twice a-week, after the second rains, till the weather grows
too warm in the spring; and there is game for such as love shooting at
the same seasons, as also plenty of quails spring and autumn.

From the above account it would appear that the _English_ in particular
use a good deal of exercise: but it ought to be considered, that, if
we except a little walk in an evening on the house-top, what has been
mentioned is the whole they take; the greatest part of their time besides
being spent in the compting-house, or in reading; so that they are rather
sedentary than active.

Though, from what has been said of the people of this country in general,
their character may not appear the most amiable; yet the _Europeans_ have
no reason to complain of their behaviour. Their capitulations with the
_Port_ prevents their being any way subject to the oppressions of the
government; and the _bashaws_, and the people of distinction, usually
treating the consuls with civility and respect, others of course follow
their example; so that we live among them in great security in the city,
and can travel abroad unmolested by _Arabs_ or _Curds_, where the natives
dare not venture, though defended by a much greater force. This is owing
partly to a small annual present sent to the Prince of the _Arabs_, and
the civil treatment that the _Curds_ sometimes meet with at _Scanderoon_,
and partly to our travelling with no more money than what is absolutely
necessary for our expences; so that they would get but little by us.
And besides, an insult of this nature would be made a pretence by the
_Turkish_ government for chastising them severely: whereas, if they rob a
native, they generally, in money and horse-furniture, find a good booty;
and, unless he happens to be a person in power, he dares not complain, as
he would run the risk of being fleeced of as much more by the very person
who should procure him redress.

The epidemic diseases which prevail most in _Aleppo_, are continual
fevers, various species of intermittents and remittents, dysenteries,
catarrhal fevers, quinsies, rheumatisms, pleurisies, and peripneumonies;
to which may be added the plague. During the extreme heats an anomalous
fever, sometimes with, at others without a diarrhœa or dysentery, is
exceeding frequent among very young children; and in _August_ and
_September_ the ophthalmia, which is not very rare, even in other months,
is so common that in most years at least one sixth of the inhabitants are
more or less afflicted with it[484].

Though the continual fevers of the spring are often attended with worse
symptoms, in appearance, than those of the autumn, yet in general they
are not so dangerous. The former discover themselves sometimes about the
beginning of _January_, though more frequently about the vernal equinox,
and disappear in _June_: the latter sometimes begin in _June_, but more
commonly in _July_; by the autumnal equinox they come to their height,
and generally go off by the beginning of _December_. The intermittents
and dysenteries commence and finish exactly at the same seasons as the
autumnal continual fever, and the spring intermittents follow the course
of the continual fever of that season.

General inflammatory fevers, catarrhal fevers, rheumatisms, quinsies,
pleurisies, and peripneumonies, make their appearance in the months of
_December_, _January_, _February_, _March_, and sometimes _April_; but
they are seldom either frequent or remarkably violent.

If we set aside the ophthalmia, there are none of the above diseases more
acute than they are commonly in _Britain_; nor can I say more frequent,
except the plague, of which hereafter, and certain malignant, remittent,
and intermittent fevers, that sometimes break out with great vehemence;
but this is only in particular years, or in such towns and villages as
are situated near stagnant waters, whether naturally marshes, or that,
for the benefit of the silk-gardens, they lay them under water by art:
and the bad effects of such situations is evident even in _Aleppo_, where
those who inhabit the houses on the fosse of the town, now turned into
gardens, are always most subject to intermittents.

The _Europeans_ are but very seldom affected by any epidemics. This
perhaps may in part be owing to their not conversing much with, the
natives, and so keeping out of the way of the contagion, of which
most of those diseases partake in a greater or less degree; partly to
their living above stairs, and not in the cool and damp air, which
the fountains in their little courts and gardens occasion; and partly
likewise, because the _Europeans_ do not indulge themselves so freely
as the natives in the use of crude and indigestible fruits. That these
circumstances strongly co-operate towards their preservation, may also
be inferred from hence, that the _European_ priests, who mix much with
the natives, and those _Europeans_ who are married, and have houses in
the country-manner, are as subject to the attacks of every reigning
epidemic as the natives themselves. It must be likewise observed, that
when a disease seizes any one of the different sorts of people who reside
here, its symptoms and progress are exactly the same in all, whether
_European_, _Turk_, _Jew_, or native Christian: but it must be at the
same time remarked, that, in treating the sick, regard must be had to
their very different method of living; for those who are accustomed to
drink nothing stronger than water or coffee, will not bear so warm a
regimen, as those, who are accustomed to fermented and spirituous liquors.

The generality of fevers here, though of the continual kind, and indeed
almost all acute diseases in this place, are subject to exacerbations
once or twice in twenty-four hours, which are usually accompanied by a
flushing in one or both cheeks, and the critical days and evacuations
agree much better with the account given of them by the ancients than
they are observed to do in _Britain_: but I could never discover the
truth of Dr. _Brown_’s remark[485], That “as to fevers at and about
_Aleppo_, though they have the same type there as in _England_, yet there
are two things peculiar to them; one is, that in acute fevers cold sweat
commonly signifies recovery, but hot sweat portends death; the other
is, that in such acute fevers even an intermittent pulse denounces no
danger.” Perhaps this might have been peculiar to some epidemic that
prevailed at the time the Doctor was at _Aleppo_; but, during all the
time I resided there, I am certain that both the one and the other have
been as dangerous symptoms in _Aleppo_ as any where else. And probably
he may have been led into a mistake by the common expression of the
natives, who give the appellation of a cold sweat to such a critical one,
as having carried off the fever, leaves the body cool, and of course the
sweat that remains upon it feels cool: whereas, what they call a hot
sweat, is such as often happens in fevers without any abatement of the
symptoms, so that both the body and sweat remain hot; and such sort of
sweats are bad symptoms, as often in other places as in _Aleppo_.

The _Europeans_, particularly the _English_, are subject, soon after
their arrival, to a very violent fever; which however seldom lasts
above twenty-four hours. This, from what cause I know not, has got the
name of the _goose_. It is necessary to bleed largely in this fever, and
the most prudent way is to purge the patient once or twice at proper
intervals after the disease is removed. When they have remained any time
at _Scanderoon_, they are often seized with tertian agues soon after they
arrive at _Aleppo_, which is also common to the natives that live upon
the coast, though they have been well while they continued there, and
the disease not at all epidemic in the city. If it is in the winter, or
spring, these fevers are commonly regularly formed, and easily cured;
but in the autumn they are of a very bad kind, and, if the bark is not
soon given, are not a little dangerous. The ingenious Mr. _Cleghorn_’s
account of the tertians of _Minorca_ answers exactly to those of
_Cyprus_, _Scanderoon_, the coast of _Syria_, and what some years happen
at _Aleppo_; and a long course of experience has convinced me that his
method of cure is the safest, as well as the most successful.

The Christians, from the great quantity of oil they eat in their Lent,
and that too mostly burnt, as frying is their favourite manner of
dressing that kind of victuals, are at such seasons subject to a feverish
disorder, attended with a cough. The skin over the whole body feels hot,
parched, and dry; but it is most violent in the palms of the hands and
soles of the feet. They wheez much in breathing, and labour by coughing
to expectorate, but without effect. Bleeding, a gentle laxative, with the
plentiful use of pectoral and saponaceous diluters, soon remove their
complaints.

The _mal d’Aleppo_, of which a more particular account shall be given
hereafter, is a disease that may properly be called here endemial.
Of sporaides, the following are the most frequent, _viz._ Almost all
the diseases that the eyes are subject to, which are many of them the
consequences of the ophthalmia. Obstructions of the abdominal viscera,
often the consequences of acute diseases, and to which also they are
much subjected by the nature of their aliment, want of exercise, method
of fitting, and also in the men their large and tight-bound girdles.
Ruptures and hæmorrhoids, which they are much afflicted with, seem to
owe their origin to some of the same causes. The tinea seems occasioned
from nastiness, as they seldom so much as uncover either their children
or grown people’s heads but in the bagnio; and worms, one kind or other
of which scarce one person, either young or old, are free from, seem
also to take their rise from the nature of their aliment. The leprosy
is now exceeding rare in these countries, but scorbutic eruptions and
putrid gums very common. Notwithstanding their jealousy and strict watch
over their women, the venereal disease is very frequent amongst them.
As they have no idea of a gonorrhœa different from what is mentioned in
their own authors, they neither conceive it to be infectious, nor to be
in danger of ending in a worse disease. The consequence of the first is,
the spreading of the infection; and of the last, that it often terminates
in a pox. When this appears, it is called _Frank zahmedy_, or the _Frank_
disease, probably from their having it first from _Europe_; and they
are then much alarmed: and though they imagine this to be infectious,
yet are more apt to attribute it to their having smoked out of the same
pipe, or ate out of the same spoon, _&c._ with a person infected, than to
any other cause. As the natives know very little of the use of mercury,
numbers of them labour under the disease great part of their lives, and
some without any very considerable uneasiness; the warmth of the climate,
and frequent use of the bagnio, may perhaps conduce towards preventing
its making a very quick progress.

Such persons as have any tendency to a phthisis pulmonalis should avoid
the air of _Aleppo_, for it is seldom that any afflicted with that
disease outlives a few months, if they do not leave the place.

Besides these diseases already mentioned, all others known in _Britain_
are to be met with at _Aleppo_, and nearly in the same proportion, except
the gout, which is rare amongst them, and mostly hereditary.




PART II.

OBSERVATIONS on the Epidemical Diseases in the City of _Aleppo_.




CHAP. I.

_Observations on the WEATHER in General._


The weather at _Aleppo_ differing but very little in any one year from
another, I thought it would save a great deal of unnecessary trouble, if
I gave a general account of the weather usual in every month, drawn from
a meteorological register, regularly kept, with only few intermissions,
for about ten years, and afterwards noted what was particular.

The barometer used in the following observations was _English_, and
graduated according to the measure of that country. The first column
denotes inches, the second 10ths of an inch.

The thermometers, (for, from accidents of breaking, several were used)
except for the last two years, were small portable ones, graduated
according to _Farenheit_’s scale; the other was larger, upon the same
scale. All of them were of mercury, and (as well as the barometer) made
by the accurate Mr. _Bird_ in _London_.

The situation of the instruments for the years 1743, 44, 45, and those
of 52 and 53, was in a little wooden _kiosk_[486], facing the east,
which projected over a narrow street that run south and north, with high
buildings on each side. The sun had only access by the south-window, and
that scarce an hour in the day. To this place there was a free ingress of
air, the two opposite windows, and often the whole, being constantly open
from the month of _April_ till the latter end of _October_; and in the
winter, though these windows were shut, a free access still remained by
the door, and a window which opened into a passage fronting the west, the
outer door of which in the day-time was always open. Add to this, that
these wooden kiosks have not either their wood-work, or numerous windows,
so well closed as to prevent a pretty considerable communication with the
external air through the chinks.

This is the situation which appears to be much preferable to any
other, and from which the general account of the weather is taken.
But a multiplicity of practice rendering it impossible for me to keep
the register, I was obliged to a friend, who was so kind as to take
that trouble for me; and then the thermometer was placed in a vaulted
south-room, which was defended from the west by two other rooms, and
opposite to the window a door opened into a large vaulted hall. In the
winter (particularly the forenoon) this was frequently open, and in the
summer-months was shut only by a door made of lattice-work, the window
being open all that season. In this country the rooms so situated are
remarkably warm in winter, and cool in summer.

In this last position the thermometer must be understood to be kept from
_July_ 1746 till the end of 1747. Both these situations being within
doors, were some degrees warmer than the external air in winter, as would
appear from the thermometer never sinking to the freezing point even in
time of frost; and they are cooler than the external air in summer, as I
have found by several trials. These things were necessary to be premised,
as they may account for the variations in the instrument, that are
remarkable in the different situations.


_JANUARY._

The weather in _January_ is commonly either frosty or rainy. What snow
falls is chiefly in this month; but it is in no great quantity, and does
not lie many hours. The middle of the month is its most usual time of
falling, and then it often remains frosty till the end.

Whenever rain falls, it is usually in the night, and in very heavy
showers.

The winds are moderate, and mostly from the northern or eastern quarter.

  Least             34     Least      28 6     in one day, 4 deg.

The most common height of the thermometer at nine in the morning is 40
and 46, and the difference between that and three in the afternoon a
gradual rise of 3 or 4 deg. In rainy days, or even such as are cloudy,
this variation seldom exceeds 1 or 2 deg. and often there is none at all;
and this observation holds through all the year.


_FEBRUARY._

This month is for the most part as rainy as the former; with this
difference, that neither rain nor fair weather continue so many days
together, but change from one to the other every four or five days. A
little snow often falls in this month, and commonly there are a few
frosty days. It is very often cloudy, though no rain falls, particularly
in the afternoon; but they are light, white clouds. At such times the air
without doors is moderately warm. The winds are much as in the preceding
month, till towards the end, and then it sometimes blows hard westerly.

The first fortnight, the usual morning-height of the thermometer is from
42 to 47; the variation between the morning and evening observation,
1, 2, or 3 deg. In the last fortnight, when there happens no frost, it
gradually rises to about 50, and the difference between morning and
evening commonly 4 or 5.


_MARCH._

A good deal of rain falls in the month of _March_; but it is generally in
short, hard showers, and often accompanied with thunder. At such times
the weather is dark and gloomy; but for the greater part it is clear,
only a few white light clouds. The weather begins to be hot in the open
air.

The winds are stronger than in the preceding months, and blow much
oftener westerly.

  Least             44     Least      28 6     in one day, 9 deg.

The common height of the thermometer in the morning is in the beginning
of the month as in the end of the last; about the middle, 52; the end,
56 to 58. The difference between morning and evening observations become
more considerable as the month advances; in the beginning, commonly 5;
the end, 8 to 9. If it rains, the variation is very inconsiderable, as
has been mentioned before.


_APRIL._

This month is in general fair, clear weather, with white, light clouds
in the afternoon; seldom dark or cloudy, except when it rains, which it
does in hard thunder-showers as in the last month, but not so often.
There are commonly a few close, hazey days; these happen when there are
light breezes northerly or easterly; but the winds in general are fresh
westerly.

The days begin to grow very hot, but the mornings and evenings as yet
remain cool.

  Least             51     Least      28 5     in one day, 10 deg.

The mercury in the thermometer has its morning-station gradually raised
from 60 to 66 as the month advances, and the variation 8 to 10 between
the morning and evening observation, except when it rains.


_MAY._

_May_ has generally one or two hard showers of rain, sometimes
accompanied with hail, and often thunder; at others, the weather is
serene, with very few clouds, and those light and white.

The weather begins to grow very warm in this month, particularly when
calm, or the wind northerly or easterly; but the wind for much the
greater part is fresh, and westerly. And here it will not be amiss to
observe, that, during the whole of the summer, the westerly winds have a
considerable influence over the thermometer. When they are weak, the heat
encreases; if calm, it becomes still hotter; but even then not so hot as
when a northerly or easterly wind blows, which raises the mercury several
degrees, and makes the air very disagreeable. _See_ p. 14.

                   Therm.            Barom.

  Least             67     Least      28 6     therm. in one day, 10 deg.

The usual station of the mercury in the thermometer is at the beginning
70, and it gradually rises, as the month advances, to 76 or 80. The
variation between the morning and evening observation rises also from 6
to 9.


_JUNE._

This month is serene throughout, seldom so much as a few flying clouds to
be seen. It is very rare that even so much as one shower of rain falls,
and that at most but for a few minutes.

The westerly winds reign chiefly in this month; and freshening after
mid-day, often continue through the night, which allay the extreme heat,
now become very troublesome.

  Least             76     Least      28 5      in one day, 12 deg.

The morning-height of the mercury, at seven o’clock, gradually encreases
with the month, from 76 to about 80; as that of the afternoon, at four
o’clock, does from 84 to 92.


_JULY._

_July_ differs very little from the former month; the weather constantly
serene.

The westerly winds usually blow fresh; but, if they fail, it becomes
excessive hot.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height  101     Greatest   28 9   Greatest variation of therm.

Eighty, is the common height of the mercury, in the morning, at the
beginning of the month, as 85, 86 is at the end. The difference between
the morning and evening observation, 8 or 10.


_AUGUST._

Till about the 20th, _August_ is exactly like the two preceding months:
from that to the end, there usually appear a number of white clouds, but
larger than any that accidentally appear in other summer-months. These
are commonly termed the _Nile clouds_; and from this time, the dews
(which are scarce ever observed in the two preceding months) begin to
fall in the nights; but they are not very considerable.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height   97     Greatest   29     Greatest variation in the
  Least             74     Least      28 4     therm. in one day, 10 deg.

The height of the thermometer, till the clouds appear, is pretty much the
same as in that of last month; but, whenever they come, they commonly
sink it 4 or 5 degrees.


_SEPTEMBER._

For the first fortnight this month is like the former, or rather more
sultry, as the wind seldom blows strong. If no rain falls, this weather
continues all the month; but usually between the 15th and 25th dark,
gloomy clouds arise; and a squal, in the nature of a whirlwind, blows
from the westward, bringing with it a great cloud of dust that covers the
whole city. This prognosticates rain, and in one or two days more some
heavy showers fall, either in the city, or not far off. These are called
the first rains; and though they are usually inconsiderable, yet the air
is much cooled, and the remainder of the month rendered very pleasant.

Seldom a night passes without much lightening in the north-west quarter,
but not attended by thunder. When this lightening appears in the west or
south-west points, it is a sure sign of the approaching rain, which is
often followed by thunder.

The winds in _September_ are westerly, but often not more than light
breezes.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height   92     Greatest   29     Greatest difference of the
  Least             62     Least      28 6     therm. in one day, 12 deg.

In the beginning of this month, the usual morning-height of the
thermometer is much as in the end of _August_; the variation between the
morning and evening observation rather more considerable. The falling of
rain sinks it 3 or 4 degrees, and it usually keeps falling all the month
till it gets to 65. The variation in one day seldom then, exceeds 3 or 4,
and just at the falling of the rain much less, perhaps 1 or 2.


_OCTOBER._

Till the second rains fall in _October_, the weather is serene, cool,
and rather more pleasant than at any other time of the year; afterwards
it becomes more variable. These rains are usually regulated by those in
_September_, being between twenty and thirty days after them; and, like
them also, the quantity varies considerably in different years. However,
those of _October_ are seldom less than three or four days; but it must
not be understood that it continues a constant rain during the whole of
those days.

The winds are rarely strong in this month, but are commonly variable.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height   84     Greatest   29     Greatest difference of the
  Least             51     Least      28 6     therm. in one day, 10 deg.

The morning-height of the thermometer, till the rains fall, is usually
about 72; the difference between the morning and evening observation,
5 or 6. After the falling of the rains it gradually sinks to 60. The
variation then in one day is seldom more than 3 or 4, on the rainy days
commonly less.


_NOVEMBER._

_November_ may be reckoned one of the rainy months, though frequently
there is an interval of very fine weather. The number of rainy days
rarely exceed seven or eight, and most of them only a few heavy showers.
It is unusual to see snow fall in this month; but after the first
fortnight it is generally frosty in the morning when the weather is
serene.

The winds are variable, seldom strong, but more inclined to the north and
east than any of the other quarters.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height   65     Greatest   29 1   Greatest variation of the
  Least             44     Least      28 4     therm. in one day, 8 deg.

As the month advances, the mercury in the thermometer gradually falls
from 60 to 50; the former being its usual morning-height at the
beginning, as the latter is at the end. The variation in one day, from 5
to 2; but on rainy days there is very often no variation at all.


_DECEMBER._

This is usually a rainy month, and much more cloudy, foggy weather in the
intervals than in the preceding, consequently not near so agreeable. The
greatest number of rainy days mentioned in the register is 16, the fewest
6, commonly 8 or 9.

There is always more or less frosty weather in this month, and frequently
a little snow. This falls out commonly after or about the end of the
first fortnight, and with it commences the cold weather.

The winds are, as in the preceding month, commonly easterly or northerly,
and seldom strong.

                   Therm.            Barom.
  Greatest height   55     Greatest   29 1   Greatest difference of the
  Least             40     Least      28 4     therm. in one day, 5 deg.

Forty-six is the common height of the thermometer through this month. The
difference between the morning and evening observation, when it does not
rain, is often 3.




CHAP. II.

_Of the WEATHER from the Year 1742 to 1747, and of the Years 1752 and
1753._


_A. D._ MDCCXLII.

The winter of this year was more severe than usual in this country, and
much less rain in _March_ and _April_ than is customary at that season.

About the end of _April_ the weather became very warm, and continued so
till the 20th of _May_; from which time, till the 22d of _June_, it grew
rather cool for the season of the year, the air being refreshed by strong
westerly breezes.

The 22d of _June_, the wind changed to north-west, and was very moderate;
upon which the weather became exceeding hot, and continued so all that
month, and for the first ten days in _July_. The remainder of the summer
was such as is common in this country, without any of the hot easterly
winds.

On the 25th of _September_ the first rains fell, and continued only one
day; after which the weather was extremely pleasant till the end of
_October_; when the second rains fell, and continued a few days. Upon
their ceasing, it set in fair and serene till the 14th of _December_;
when a small shock of an earthquake was felt, and a hard frost began,
which continued all that month.

For want of proper instruments, the changes of heat and cold this year
are here represented according to what they appeared to our senses.


_A. D._ MDCCXLIII.

From the beginning of _January_ till the middle, a great deal of
snow fell, the frost continued, and the air was exceeding cold; the
thermometer being but once above 40 in the evening, and in the morning
commonly 36, once 34, on the third at 9, A. M. A few days of fair,
pleasant weather succeeded this cold, and then began violent rains, which
continued during the remainder of the month.

The rains were almost constant till the 20th of _February_; the latter
part of which month was fair, pleasant weather.

_March_ set in with variable spring-weather, (though somewhat cooler than
usual), which continued till the 23d; from which time till the end a
great quantity of rain, hail, and thunder.

_April_ was fair (except one thunder-shower) till the 19th; during which
the weather was pretty warm, with a sort of haziness in the air. The
20th and 21st, it blew very hard from the south-west, with much rain,
and the weather became unusually cool for the season. The mercury in
the thermometer, which had before commonly rose to 74 in the afternoon,
seldom afterwards getting up so high as 66 during the whole month, which
was attended with a good deal of rain and thunder, some hail, and the
wind generally fresh westerly.

_May_ (except on the 13th and 23d, when some severe thunder-showers fell)
was fair, pleasant weather, and much cooler than usual. The thermometer
was unfortunately broke this month; so that from this time till _May_
following, the observations were made by a large thermometer, filled with
spirits, which showed distinctly the changes of heat and cold, but was
not upon any known scale.

The beginning of _June_ was fair and cool weather for the season. On the
10th it began to be hot; and, notwithstanding strong westerly winds, and
often flying clouds, the air was very hot during the rest of the month.
On the 12th, at 8 P. M. were felt two small shocks of an earthquake. The
sky was at that time serene, and it blew fresh.

On the night between the 1st and 2d of _July_, some severe
thunder-showers fell; a thing very extraordinary at this season. During
the whole of the month, the westerly wind blew fresh, and generally
continued great part of the night, by which means the air was rendered
remarkably cool.

This chill weather continued a few days in _August_; but the remainder
of that month, the winds, though westerly, being moderate, and ceasing a
little after sunset, together with its succeeding such cool weather, made
it seem uncommonly warm, though from the thermometer it appeared that
the heat was not in reality greater than in other years. On the 19th, at
half an hour after eleven o’clock at night, was felt a small shock of an
earthquake. The sky was at that time serene, and little wind stirring.

The beginning of _September_ was hot, as in _August_; but on the 10th it
became sultry, particularly in the night, and continued so till the 18th
at night, when the first rains began to fall; and though they were but
moderate, they rendered the remainder of the month quite cool.

Though it rained a little on the 8th of _October_, and continued cloudy
for several days; yet the second rains did not, properly speaking, fall
till the 23d, when they were plentiful, and continued three days. The
remainder of that month, and all the rest of the year, afforded nothing
remarkable.


_A. D._ MDCCXLIV.

The snow which fell on the 5th of _January_ lay six inches deep, and
continued for several days in places shaded from the sun; which is not
usual in this country; the quantity that fell in this month was likewise
somewhat extraordinary.

_February_ and _March_ had nothing in them different from other years.

_April_ was more rainy than customary. On the 28th, at half an hour after
one in the morning, were two pretty brisk shocks of an earthquake, and at
six in the evening another.

_May_ and _July_ were as usual in a moderate summer; but _June_ had more
northerly winds, and was hotter than common; the usual height of the
thermometer being 95.

From the first week in _August_, several days of easterly winds rendered
the air unusually hot, which by a very singular, though but small, shower
of rain on the 30th, was cooled for a few days; the thermometer, P. M.
falling from 92 to 83.

The first rains were ushered in by the accustomed squall of wind on the
4th of _September_ at night, and were violent for a few hours, but did
not cool the air. On the 20th and 22d, one shower of rain fell, and
rendered it more cool; and the plentiful rain on the evening of the 23d,
and greatest part of the day on the 24th, completed it.

On the 16th of _October_, at night, the second rains fell, with a good
deal of thunder, and on the 19th some more; after which the rest of the
year afforded nothing that was remarkable.


_A. D._ MDCCXLV.

This year had nothing uncommon in the weather till the 12th of _March_,
when it became cold; and an unusual frost, with, a north-east wind for a
few days, nipped most of the blossoms on the trees; the mercury in the
thermometer after noon being rarely above 54, whereas before it was at 62.

_April_ was remarkably dry, having but one shower of rain, on the 6th.
_May_ and _June_ had nothing extraordinary.

_July_, except a few days at the latter end, and all _August_, not being
refreshed with the westerly breezes, and having several days of easterly
wind, particularly the middle of _August_, were extremely hot; the
afternoons height of the thermometer being often 100, and twice 101.

The first rains were very moderate, and fell on the 10th _September_,
being as usual preceded by a squal of wind. The second rains fell heavy
and seasonable, about the middle of _October_; from which time happened
nothing singular all the rest of the year.


_A. D._ MDCCXLVI.

The 4th, 5th, and 6th of _January_ this year, it snowed almost
continually; so that it lay in the streets above a foot thick, which is
very uncommon. It was not all thaw’d in the city for some days; and in
such places abroad where the sun-beams did not reach, there was still
some lying on the 13th. From this time till _June_ the weather was as
usual.

It began to blow very hard westerly on the 13th _June_, and the wind
brought along with it many clouds, which let fall two small showers of
rain on the 14th, one at 10 A. M. the other at 7 P. M. which sunk the
mercury in the thermometer from 84, its usual afternoon’s height, to 76
three fourths.

_August_ had none of the usual cloudy weather; yet the rest of the summer
had nothing in it particular.

Though it began to be cloudy on the 4th of _September_, and continued so
for a few days, and even thundered; yet no rain fell till the 11th in the
afternoon, and then only a gentle shower of about an hour, which sunk the
thermometer from 82 and an half, its common afternoon’s height, to 77. It
soon however rose again; and the wind being easterly or northerly from
the 20th to the end of the month, the weather was unusually warm; the
afternoon height of the mercury being 85 or 86.

In the month of _October_ there fell but one shower of rain, the 25th P.
M. so that the thermometer kept high all the month, and the weather was
extremely pleasant.

On the 2d and 3d of _November_ the rains fell plentifully; and, through
the whole of this and the succeeding month, more fell than is usual in
other years. There did not happen either frost or snow.


_A. D._ MDCCXLVII.

From the beginning of _January_ till the end of _March_, the winds were
much higher than usual at that season, neither was there any frost or
snow; but more rain fell in _January_ and _February_ than is common, and
the weather in general was bleak and unpleasant. The rest of the year
till _September_ was mild, and very moderate.

Though it was cloudy, and threatened rain about the 20th of _September_,
yet none fell in this month at _Aleppo_; so the thermometer’s evenings
height kept up at 82 till the end of the month.

The whole of _October_ was clear and settled weather, except one
thunder-shower on the 13th, (which sunk the mercury in the thermometer
from 81 to 73) a small shower on the 22d, and a gentle rain the whole of
the 24th.

On the 7th of _November_ the rains began to fall plentifully, the weather
became as in other years, but there was no frost in this month.

_December_ was rather more foggy than common, without either frost or
snow.

Being, for want of leisure, prevented from giving a particular account
of the epidemic diseases from 1748 to 1751, that of the weather is also
omitted.

The change of stile from the _Julian_ to the _Gregorian_ rendering
references to the general account of the weather, which were made
according to the _Julian_ calendar, indistinct, I conceived it necessary
to give the weather of the years 1752 and 1753 compleat.

It is true that the short method formerly used might have served till
_September_, as the act of parliament did not take place till the 3d of
that month: but, besides the want of uniformity that would have attended
a change in the method before the year was out, I thought, that, if
there were any who should make an objection to the former, this would
make them some atonement; and that it could be disagreeable to none,
more especially as the epidemic fevers of those two years changed their
appearances so remarkably according to the season.

The thermometer used, till noted otherwise, was the large one, and the
situation during the whole two years in the wooden kiosk. Where-ever
a rainy day occurs, with one ′, it is to be understood that a small
shower or two happened on that day; ‴ denotes violent rains, and ″ an
intermediate degree of rain.

CHAP. III.

_Of the Epidemical Diseases, from the beginning of 1742 to the end of
1747, and of the Years 1752 and 1753._


_A. D._ MDCCXLII.

This year was very healthy, till about the beginning of _March_; when
an acute fever, attended with a pain in the right hypochonder, became
very frequent, both among adults and children, though few of those were
seized with it who were under ten years old. Copious bleeding, emollient
glysters, cooling purges, with antiphlogistic medicines internally, and
emollient fomentations to the part affected, generally relieved the
symptoms, and brought the fever to a favourable crisis on the seventh or
ninth day in adults by a plentiful sweat, and in children most commonly
by a diarrhœa.

In some these evacuations only carried off the pain, and brought the
fever to a regular intermission; when it was soon and safely cured by
the cortex; though, if any errors were committed in the use of the
non-naturals, the patients were very subject to relapses.

But when evacuations were not used in due time, the disease often proved
fatal, or at best the fever was protracted to thirty, and even forty
days, and some few of the sick died hectic.

Though the above mentioned fever did not quite disappear till the autumn;
yet, after the beginning of _June_, it affected so few, that it could
scarcely be called epidemical.

Inflammatory quinsies were also frequent at this time; but they were not
violent, and quickly yielded to the common methods.

Through the winter the plague had been frequent in _Antab_, _Kilis_,
_Azass_, and most of the villages among the mountains _Amanus_; to which
places, according to the best information we could get, it had been
brought from _Bias_[489], where it had raged the summer before.

The _Chinganas_, who came as usual from these parts, about the middle
of _April_, to be hired for reaping corn, brought it with them to
_Aleppo_. To these, and a few others in the out-parts of the town, it
was confined for some time; and it was not till the 18th of _May_, that
we had any notice of it, when, upon strict enquiry, it was found that
there had been some seized with the distemper in the city. In a few
days, it encreased pretty much among the _Jews_ (who suffered greatly in
proportion to their small number this season) and came to be more general
through the city and suburbs, where it continued, though in a limited
degree, till the beginning of _July_, when the extream heat of the
weather put a considerable check to it: some, however, were daily carried
off by the disease till near the end of this month, when it entirely
ceased. The _Europeans_ shut up[490] this year the beginning of _June_,
and continued so about a month.

About the middle of _July_, diarrhœas and dysenteries became very
frequent. The discharges at first were bilious, and the gripes violent.
A very high fever was a constant attendant often with petechiæ, and
other malignant symptoms: plentiful bleeding was always necessary at
the beginning; after which an ipecacuan vomit, with a few doses of
rhubarb (found most effectual when a few grains of calomel were added)
prepared the way for anodynes and gentle astringents: these, with soft
mucilaginous aliment, in most instances, compleated the cure; but
in several, from a promising appearance, it proved suddenly mortal:
this was likewise the case with some in intermitting fevers that were
now epidemic, and continued with the dysentery all the autumn. This
unexpected fatality happened at times, to such as were not shut up, in
all acute diseases during the time of the plague; but buboes, or other
signs of that distemper, were seen but seldom[491].

About the beginning of _September_, the small-pox made their appearance,
especially amongst children; but being of a mild distinct kind, very
little assistance was required from medicine. In _October_ this disease
became more frequent; and much the greater part that were seized, had
the confluent sort, attended with hæmorrhages, petechiæ, phlyctanæ, and
other the worst of symptoms. Convulsions (always violent) on their first
seizure, indicated that the pock would flux, and prove fatal. In this
confluent kind the eruptions were often discovered on the extremities as
soon as the child was observed to be out of order, and never were later
in appearing than the end of the second day. These patients generally
died on the beginning of the eleventh, reckoning from the first attack,
when the distemper was left to nature, as is commonly the case in this
country; or, if they survived, yet many of them were afterwards harrassed
with corrosive ulcers, carious bones, hard tumors on the glandular
parts, difficult either to discuss or bring to suppuration, coughs, and
fluxes; which last soon put an end to their miseries. By degrees this
great malignancy seemed to wear off; so that by _December_ the disease
became mild and favourable, and most of the sick recovered.

The _Jews_ were the most severely afflicted by this sort of small-pox.

Bleeding, bathing the extremities in warm water, with a plentiful use
of diluting, antiphlogistic medicines, if used at the beginning, often
prevented fatal consequences. Purging in the secondary fever, or after
the decline of the disease, is never practised here by the natives; from
the neglect of which, perhaps, the dreadful symptoms above enumerated
were more frequent; though they often happened when all possible means
had been used to prevent them.

Inoculation is only practised here among the Christians, and is not
yet general even among them. However, it appears to gain ground daily,
though their injudicious method of proceeding in it seems to lay this
practice under several disadvantages. They do not either prepare the
body beforehand, or consider the habit of the child to be inoculated,
or the nature of the pock, or other diseases of the party from whom
they receive infection, but carry the child to be inoculated into the
chamber of the sick; where an old woman opening one of the pustles with a
needle, takes a little of the matter upon its point; with this needle she
pricks many times the fleshly part of the child’s hand, between the first
joint of the thumb and the same joint of the fore-finger, taking up a
little more matter upon the point of the needle after every two or three
punctures; then putting a bit of cotton on the part, it is tied up, and
the operation finished.

About the middle of _November_ the plague began to shew itself again in
the suburbs called _Bankusa_[492], and that neighbourhood; and before
_Christmas_ it was found to be in some parts of the city, though it made
little or no progress.

A few pleurisies and rheumatisms began to make their appearance in
_December_.


_A. D._ MDCCXLIII.

In _January_, the small-pox, which were now for the most part distinct,
abated considerably, and by the end of _February_ they quite disappeared.

The pleurises and rheumatisms grew more common in _January_, and
continued through the greatest part of _February_. They were commonly
accompanied with headach, thirst, and other febrile symptoms. The pulse
was low, quick, and hard; the urine not so high-coloured as usual in
those inflammatory fevers, but without sediment. The blood was sizey.
The pains of the rheumatics were not generally very acute, though fixed,
and more especially in the knees, which soon swelled considerably, and
were often subject to great weakness long after the pain and fever were
removed.

In both diseases the method of cure was the same. They could not for the
most part bear such large and repeated bleeding as is usual in those
inflammatory cases at other times; but, by moderate bleeding, twice,
or at most thrice, cooling purges, emollient fomentations to the parts
in pain, a plentiful use of antiphlogistic and saponaceous diluters,
with volatiles added towards the decline of the disease, they speedily
recovered.

During the winter, a continual fever, much like that of the preceding
spring, affected several; but the pain in the right hypochonder did not
so commonly attend it.

During the course of the spring, intermittents were common; but they had
nothing in them particular.

The plague which had continued in the suburbs during all the month of
_January_, though hitherto it had made but little progress, now began to
spread among the _Jews_ in the city, and seized many of the Christians in
the month of _February_; though, as it was then diminished at _Bankusa_,
it might more properly be said to have changed its quarters, than to have
augmented its forces.

About the beginning of _March_, some _Jews_ and _Turks_, who were known
to the _Europeans_, dying suddenly, they began to be alarmed. However,
whether from a cessation of the distemper, or from great industry used
in concealing it, together with the natural credulity of mankind in what
they wish to be true, cannot easily be determined; but certain it is,
that we then heard no more of it, and most people flattered themselves
with hopes that it was entirely ceased: but, on the 20th of _March_, we
were credibly informed, that two _Jews_ were dead in the same house, and
that several other persons of different sects were dead or infected,
which raised a fresh alarm amongst us; and, in truth, the increase became
soon too visible, particularly among the _Armenians_, who suffered in a
very extraordinary manner during the whole continuance of the distemper.

Hitherto the greatest part of the infected were women and children, and
mostly in the suburbs; but, about the beginning of _April_, there was a
manifest encrease of the burials in the city, and several were seized in
the _Khanes_, where the _Europeans_ live, so that most of them shut up
the 11th of that month.

It continued encreasing gradually in all parts, and among all sorts of
people during the month of _April_, but continued its ravages in _May_
with much more violence, and arrived at its greatest height, according to
the reports we received, about the last of that month, when the number
of burials was every day apparently great. But as we had no account that
could be depended upon, it is not possible to ascertain the precise
number. Our list of the Christians was however tolerably exact; and,
notwithstanding many of them were gone out of the city, and the rest
who could afford it were shut up, though not in the most regular way,
their burials amounted from 20 to 30, and sometimes 34 a-day. Hence it
is evident, that the number of _Turks_ must have been very considerable;
though, according to the informations of those who remember former
plagues in this place, the mortality attending this was but very moderate.

About the beginning of _June_ the distemper decreased pretty much amongst
the _Turks_, according to the accounts brought to us, though the number
of Christian burials (of which we were informed with more certainty)
diminished but little. From the 13th to the 17th, it again encreased,
particularly among the _Turks_, though not to the height it was at about
the end of _May_. On the 18th it began again to decline, and continued
decreasing with a surprising rapidity, some small interruptions excepted,
till the end of the month, by which time the burials were reduced to a
very few. However, they kept at that stand the greatest part of _July_;
nor could the city be said to be quite exempt from the infection till
about the middle of _August_, though it was so much abated that most of
the _Europeans_ got abroad about the 18th of _July_.

About the beginning of _August_, intermittent fevers became frequent, and
were at their height in _September_; after which they abated, but did not
entirely cease till the close of the year.

For a few days after their commencement, they often resembled continual
fevers, with violent and irregular symptoms, not unlike those of the
plague; but, after bleeding and vomiting, or, what was most commonly
practised, purging, with a plentiful use of nitrous medicines, they
formed into tertians, double tertians, or quotidians, and were speedily
and safely cured by the use of the bark. It was remarkable in those
fevers, that they affected many more of the _Europeans_ than epidemics in
this country commonly do.

Diarrhœas were also frequent throughout the autumn, and till the end of
_December_, but without any thing particular in their symptoms.

From the middle of _November_ till the end of the year, we now and then
heard of a person dying of the plague; but these instances were very
rare, hardly more than two of whom we could be certain that they had the
distemper.


_A. D._ MDCCXLIV.

A few pleurisies and peripneumonies occurred during the months of
_January_ and _February_; but these were not either frequent or violent,
yielding, and that very quickly, to the common methods.

About the middle of _February_ the chincough broke out among the
children. It was often attended with a smart fever, and pain in the
side. Copious bleeding was necessary, cooling purges, with pectoral
and antiphlogistic medicines, and, towards the decline of the fever,
blisters, which were most effectual when applied to the part affected:
but it was not often that the parents would consent to this application,
having in general a great aversion to blistering on any account.
Notwithstanding this treatment, the fever, and often the pain, remained
fourteen days, and the cough for two or three weeks after; but the force
of it was much diminished, and the intervals between the fits long. This
disease ceased by the end of _March_.

At this time also an inflammatory fever, without affecting any particular
part, was frequent amongst children; which bleeding, purging, and nitrous
medicines, with the testacea, commonly carried off in a few days.

For want of bleeding, the above mentioned diseases proved fatal to
many, this operation being scarce ever performed upon children by the
physicians of this country. They content themselves with making a few
slight scarifications on the top of the ears, or on the calves of the
legs; from whence they seldom procure more than a few drops of blood.

The plague, which began to appear in _November_, made very little
progress during the months of _January_ and _February_. In _March_ it
became a little more apparent, and proceeded exactly in the same course
as the year before, ceasing entirely about the middle of _August_. The
number of the infected were but few; so that the _English_ nation did not
shut up at all, and some of the _French_ only towards the middle of _May_.

In the preceding years, I prescribed for the sick chiefly from the
accounts I had from a person I employed to visit them; for though,
notwithstanding all my precautions, I was often deceived by false
representations, and employed to visit some of the infected before we
shut up, yet I avoided it to the utmost of my power; but this year, the
fears of infection being (like that of all other dangers to which one has
been long exposed) much wore off, I attended the sick of the plague in
common with those under other diseases.

Intermittents made their appearance about the middle of _March_, and
continued till the beginning of _May_. Those who had laboured under this
disease in the autumn, were now the most subject to it.

As the greatest part were regular, formed tertians, a vomit or purge,
with the use of the cortex, was all that was necessary to cure them; and
the same medicine, with the warm bitters, and elixir of vitriol, were
continued for some time after, to prevent a relapse.

In _June_, _July_, _August_, and part of _September_, a malignant
fever was common, attended with much the same symptoms as the plague,
excepting buboes and carbuncles. The vomiting, with which it began,
lasted for several days, and the fever continued at least till the
fourteenth, but often longer; some few after the fourteenth had regular
intermissions.

The method of cure was much the same as that of the plague, only that
they bore a second bleeding, and nitrous medicines, better than I usually
found they did in that distemper. When the fever intermitted, the bark
was given with success.

From _June_ till _December_, intermittent fevers of various forms were
very frequent. They did not put on the appearance of continual fevers in
the beginning, like those of the last year; but, if they were not timely
stopped by the bark after the fourth paroxysm, (_viz._ the seventh day)
there was no remission; but the fever became continual, remaining at
least till the fourteenth day, but more frequently till the twenty-first,
if it did not prove fatal before, which was often the case while the warm
weather continued.

A few diarrhœas occurred between the end of _August_ and the beginning
of _January_. In _November_ and _December_ some pleurisies and quinsies
appeared; but neither of these diseases had any thing in them different
from those of other seasons.


_A. D._ MDCCXLV.

We had no disease that could be called epidemic, excepting the
spring-intermittents, which began early (_January_), and continued till
the beginning of _May_. They indeed were more frequent than usual.

The summer-fevers among the young children begun in _June_, and were
generally accompanied with a diarrhœa, but had nothing unusual.

Intermittents also made their appearance this year in _June_, and were
numerous till _December_; but though they were very liable to return,
they were not of a bad kind.

A few dysenteries were to be met with in the autumn, but scarce so many
as to entitle the disease epidemic.

In _September_, the small-pox appeared among the children. The few
that were first seized had a mild, distinct pock; but by the middle of
_October_ they became very common, and the generality of the sick had a
bad confluent kind, which proved fatal to many on the eleventh day from
their seizure; but of such as were treated after _Sydenham_’s method,
very few died. The most part of those that recovered had inflammatory
tumors on the elbows, which always suppurated, and proved tedious in
their cure; but, if timely opened, the bone was seldom affected.


_A. D._ MDCCXLVI.

The small-pox, which had raged violently in _November_ and _December_,
became milder in _January_, as also less frequent, and by the beginning
of _February_ entirely disappeared.

In _January_ and _February_ several had inflammatory fevers, which were
commonly cured in a few days by bleeding, cooling purges, and a plentiful
use of nitrous medicines.

In _June_, a putrid fever, with petechiæ, began, and continued during the
months of _July_ and _August_; but the number of the sick was but small.
It however seldom proved fatal, but commonly terminated happily by a
critical sweat on the eleventh day, or at the furthest on the fourteenth.

This autumn was most remarkably free from intermittents; none were seen
before _September_, and they totally disappeared by _November_. The
remainder of the year was very healthy.


_A. D._ MDCCXLVII.

As the last year ended, so this begun, free from any disease that had
the appearance of an epidemic. A few diarrhœas occurred during _January_
and _February_, in _April_ peripneumonies affected several, and now and
then through all these months intermittents appeared: but none of these
diseases were either frequent or dangerous; so that this season might be
esteemed one of the most healthy.

In _May_ a putrid fever broke out, and was very frequent through the
whole of the summer, and to the end of _October_; after which, though it
became less common, yet it now and then shewed itself till the end of
_January_ 1748.

This fever began with a shivering and vomiting, which were soon succeeded
by violent headachs, pains over the whole body, and an evident loss of
strength, though the pulse was full and hard for the first four days.
The tongue was first white, then became brown, hard, and dry. Most of
the sick became delirious on the fifth day, and towards the end of the
disease comatose. The heat was violent, both internally and externally,
with regular exacerbations in the evenings, preceded by flushing in the
cheeks. Purple spots, about the size of a flea-bite, generally broke
out over the whole body about the fifth day, and the fever most commonly
ended by a plentiful sweat, either on the seventh or by the ninth;
sometimes indeed it continued to the eleventh. At its first appearance,
the fourteenth day was usually critical. Signs from the urine were
very fallacious. However, in proportion to the number of the sick, and
violence of the symptoms, this fever was not very mortal.

The method found most effectual in treating the sick, was to bleed
plentifully on the first days of the disease; once to discharge the
contents of the primæ viæ, with a gentle laxative, which was the more
necessary, as the generality of the sick voided quantities of worms; to
give nitrous medicines in small doses often repeated, with the plentiful
use of the _spir. vitrioli_, and cooling glysters _pro re nata_. Towards
the end of the disease, warmer medicines were added as the state of the
pulse seemed to indicate; and blisters, when the sick could be prevailed
upon to admit them, were of great service.

In _September_ and _October_ several were seized with a fever that seemed
different from that before described, and which indeed proved fatal to
more than one half of those who were afflicted with it.

The first attack of this fever was by a slight shivering and nausea,
sometimes a vomiting. These were not succeeded by any violent heat, but
by an excessive languor, and most exquisite pains over the whole body.
The head either did not ache at all, or but very little. Several times
in a day, however, they complained of a lancinating pain, which, as
they expressed it, run through their head; and as it came suddenly, it
as suddenly went off again; and, though they had no great pain, they
complained of a giddiness, and constant noise in their ears, like the
rushing of water. From the very beginning they laboured under great
dejection of spirits; and their eyes appeared muddy, with a particular
ghastly look, much like to that of a person in the plague. The tongue
was moist; and, like one in health, for several hours they seemed to be
without thirst, or other uneasiness, and then would suddenly complain of
a violent internal heat, and drink great quantities of liquor greedily,
though neither their pulse nor tongue were altered, nor any external heat
to be observed.

The urine was of a straw-colour, without cloud or sediment, till the
sixth day, when there appeared in it a small cloud suspended about
half-way; and this appearance it had in those who died, as well as in
those who recovered. They slept very little, or not at all, during the
whole course of the disease. The pulse from the beginning to the end
was but very little quicker than natural; about the fifth day it sunk,
and about twelve hours before death was not to be felt. The sick were
scarcely ever delirious, and never comatose, continuing entirely sensible
till they expired, which was commonly on the seventh day of the disease.
Those who recovered had a crisis by a plentiful sweat on the ninth. None
of the sick had any petechiæ.

The blood that was drawn on the first day was like that of a person in
health; but, after the third day, it was of the colour of coffee-grounds,
appearing quite thin as it run out of the vein, and, when cold, was
bluish on the top, and but very loosely coagulated.

This fever did not appear any way infectious; for I observed no instance
wherein two persons had it in the same family, nor where any of the
sick could be supposed to have caught it from another affected with
the disease: and indeed the whole number of the sick that came within
my knowledge did not amount to above thirty, twelve of whom were my
own patients, and out of these I lost four. The others seemed to owe
their recovery to a pretty large bleeding, and an ipecacuan vomit
at the beginning of the disease, small and repeated doses of _pulv.
contrayervæ comp._ with a few grains of _nitr. stibiat._ gentle anodynes,
with moderate acidulated cordials _pro re nata_, and an emollient
refrigerating glyster every evening. Towards the fifth day, a warmer
regimen was necessary, with blisters applied to the back, legs, and arms,
according as the sinking of the pulse seemed to require.

Plenty of barley-water, acidulated with spirit of vitriol, was allowed
for the patient’s drink; and panada, rice-gruel, and roasted apples, for
food; though, to such as would not be contented with this diet without
the addition of butter, which is the method of this country, I chose
rather to allow weak chicken-broth, with crum of bread, or a little rice,
boiled in it.

The autumnal intermittents were this year but few; nor did any other
diseases besides those already mentioned appear so frequently as to claim
the title of epidemics.

From the year 1748 to 1751, I was prevented from taking notes in the
manner that was necessary to furnish an account of the epidemics of those
years, by a constant engagement in the duties of my profession, together
with an almost daily attendance on the _Bashaw_; which however furnished
me with an opportunity of seeing more of the manners of the people than
I should otherwise have done, and was fully recompensed by the large
presents, and other public marks of his favour, which he was pleased to
confer on me. In general, however, the first three years were healthy,
if we except the measles and small-pox, which were sometimes in this
period very frequent. The measles first made their appearance in the
spring of 1749, and finished in the spring of 1750. As this disease had
not visited _Aleppo_ for several years, it affected numbers of adults,
as well as children; so that it was no uncommon thing to see the father,
mother, children, and servants, all sick of the measles together. No
description of the disease could be more exact than that which _Sydenham_
gives us of 1670, nor any method of cure more effectual, none having died
that were treated after his manner, though it proved fatal to many of
those who were treated after the manner of the country; which is, to keep
them extremely warm, and on the ninth day to take the sick out of the hot
room, in which they have been kept, to the bagnio; without which they
imagine that the sick would fall into an incurable diarrhœa: whereas in
the small-pox, which one would imagine is a disease that should require
more washing, they don’t allow them to go to the bagnio till after the
fortieth day.

The small-pox made their appearance about the middle of _August_ 1750,
and were at first of a bad confluent kind: however, they became more mild
by the middle of _November_, and disappeared early in the spring.

The harvest of the year 1750 proved bad; so that a want of corn began to
be felt early in the winter, and the poor were much distressed for want
of bread. The new _bashaw_ embraced this opportunity to bring in large
quantities of wheat from his own granaries at _Hamah_, where it had been
hoarded up for several years; by which means it was very much damaged,
and the bread made of it was extremely black and musty: however, it was
all that the poor had to eat till the coming in of the new grain.

About the beginning of _June_ 1751, a most fatal dysentery made its
appearance, and continued till the middle of _November_; and possibly
proceeded as much from the bad bread, as the epidemic constitution of the
air, though both causes perhaps concurred in producing it.


_A. D._ MDCCLII.

The first part of the year was very healthy; but, about the vernal
equinox, a continual fever began, which attacked a great many people of
all ranks, and continued with violence till near the end of _July_; after
which the number of the sick diminished greatly, and by the middle of
_September_ this fever quite disappeared.

It began in the usual way, by a slight shivering, and often with a
nausea; to which succeeded heat, thirst, headach, and pain in the loins.
The head was much confused from the first seizure, and a remarkable
stupidity appeared in the patient’s look. The tongue became immediately
white, soon after brown, and often, towards the end of the disease,
was covered with a black crust. The pulse was quick, but seldom hard
or full, and continued in a more equal state than I ever observed in
any other fever in this country, few or none of the sick having any
remission or exacerbations, the heat and other symptoms continuing almost
uniformly at one regular standard from the beginning to the end, if the
patient’s strength was not exhausted by unseasonable evacuations and
improper management. On the ninth or eleventh day most of the sick had an
hæmorrhage from the nose, which in some seemed to mitigate the symptoms,
though many grew worse upon it; in others it had no manifest effect,
either good or bad. The crisis was almost always by a plentiful sweat;
but this happened to none at the first appearance of this disease before
the fourteenth, and to the greater part on the seventeenth.

Towards the end of _May_, the hæmorrhage commonly happened on the seventh
day, and a copious discharge by sweat on the eleventh; which, though it
very much relieved, yet was not a perfect crisis, the fever never quite
leaving them till the fourteenth. Many of the sick now had petechiæ.

As the hot weather advanced, so likewise these discharges came on
earlier in the disease; so that by the latter end of _June_ almost all
had the hæmorrhages, the fifth or seventh, and on this last the sweats
likewise. And what is very remarkable is, that from about this time till
the epidemic ceased, though the sick had been duly purged after the
fever, and the utmost care taken in respect to the non-naturals; yet
none of them escaped a relapse, which seized them in the same way as the
preceding fever, only the heat was much more intense. The second day they
were taken with violent pains in the hypochonders, bilious vomitings, and
often purging, which left them the third day; a smart fever remaining
till the fifth, with many remissions and exacerbations, when a critical
sweat put an end to it; I mean in such as had recovered of the preceding
fever on the seventh day; but such as had grown better on the fourteenth,
did not recover of the relapse before the eleventh.

Several of the sick had the fever so slightly, that they were able to
walk abroad; but, notwithstanding this mildness of the symptoms, the
disease continued the same number of days as in the others.

Though this fever was not in its own nature very dangerous, yet it
proved fatal to many, particularly in the months of _April_ and _May_,
when the number of the sick was very great, and the fever was of long
continuance. The increase of its mortality was probably owing to bleeding
and purging, which were often used by the natives towards the eleventh
day of the disease, and to which they were prompted by the spontaneous
hæmorrhages, and an impatience under the long duration of the fever;
but it seldom happened that any evacuations were used after the eighth
day, without manifest detriment to the sick, either by retarding their
recovery, or sinking them irretrievably.

Of several hundreds that were treated after the following method, only
two died. As soon as the person was taken ill, he was blooded pretty
largely; next day he took a laxative potion of _infus. sennæ limon._
and manna, and in the evening of that day a gentle anodyne. If he was
strong and plethoric, the bleeding was repeated the third day; but, after
this, blood was seldom, if ever, taken. Nitrous medicines, with a small
proportion of _pulv. contrayerv. composit._ were given every six hours,
and the last encreased or diminished according as the pulse seemed to
require; and towards the end of the disease, or when the pulse was low,
the _pulv. contrayerv. comp. Phar. Edin._ was substituted in its stead. A
glyster of milk, pulp of cassia fistula, or sugar, and a little oil, was
injected every evening till the eleventh, if the head was much confused,
and the body costive, which was generally the case in the first months;
though afterwards, when the disease became more acute, most of the sick
had several stools every day.

When petechiæ appeared, and the heat was intense, with great languor,
moderate cordials, acidulated with _spir. vitrioli_, together with the
above mentioned powders, were repeated as necessity required.

The second day after the crisis, they were purged with the same potion as
at the beginning, and it was repeated at proper intervals, once or twice:
when a tendency to relapses became so general, a decoction of the cortex,
with a small proportion of _elixir vitrioli_, was given to prevent them,
and often with success.

In these relapses, though the symptoms seemed violent, they were seldom
or never blooded. When the vomiting came on, the sick were ordered to
drink quantities of warm water, to wash the stomach; glysters were
occasionally injected, and the medicines before mentioned exhibited.

The patient’s drink was a ptisan, in common use here, made of barley,
grass-roots, and a few injubs, sometimes acidulated with lemon-juice;
their food, weak chicken-broth, with a little rice, or crum of bread,
boiled in it, and now and then a roasted apple.

From the beginning of the summer till the end of _September_, the
chincough was frequent among the children; but though it was very
violent, it much sooner gave way to medicines than I ever knew it; for
by once bleeding, (which was generally with leeches) a few purges, and a
weak solution of gum ammoniac in water, with a small proportion of _acet.
scillitic. & tinct. castor._ they either soon recovered, or the cough
grew much less frequent and violent, and went off entirely in about a
fortnight more.

This year the fever usually attending young children was more frequent
than in others.

Scarcely one intermittent was to be met with this autumn; and the place
was exceeding healthy till the middle of _November_, when a fever became
very frequent (chiefly among children three years old and upwards) with
a swelling in one or both parotids, the maxillary glands, and sometimes
over the whole face.

Bleeding, with a gentle purgative once or twice repeated, and a low diet,
generally cured those that had it the most violently in five or six days,
and such as had it slightly recovered without any assistance in about the
same time; and though this fever continued to affect great numbers all
the year, and till about the middle of _January_ 1753, I did not hear of
any to whom it proved fatal.


_A. D._ MDCCLIII.

With this year commenced a continual fever, which was chiefly confined
to adults, and to the northern suburbs of the city, where the Christians
mostly inhabit.

The disease began with a shivering and nausea, but the patient seldom
vomited. The heat was intense during the first two or three days, the
pulse strong and frequent: the sick did not so much complain of pain, as
of great confusion in their head, and noise in their ears, acute pains
in their back, legs, and arms; which last they could scarcely bear to
move. The tongue was at first white, afterwards yellow, and towards the
height of the disease generally black. From the beginning their aspect
was stupid, and by the sixth day they became delirious; from the seventh
to the ninth petechiæ appeared over the whole body, not round, as usual,
but in irregular figures. The pulse by this time began to sink, and they
were often comatose; from the ninth to the eleventh, a moderate sweat
sometimes broke out, or they had a few loose stools, which seemed to
relieve, and for the present to abate the symptoms; yet the fever always
continued till the seventeenth day, when it began to decline gradually,
and went off without any remarkable evacuation. When the head was much
affected, the urine was pale as water, without any sediment; in some it
was of a blackish cast, like a weak tincture of steel. On the eleventh
day it commonly let fall a white sediment in those who recovered; and
indeed all who were treated in the method mentioned for the continual
fever of last year (with the addition of sinapisms to the soles of the
feet, for they are much averse to blisters) recovered.

Those who were bled to any considerable quantity after the seventh day
generally died on the ninth or the eleventh.

This fever continued to prevail till the beginning of _February_,
when the very cold weather we had at that time put a check to it; so
that, from the beginning to the 20th, I saw but two persons who had
any appearance of it. These, besides the above mentioned symptoms, had
an acute pain in the right hypochonder affecting their breathing, and
bore larger bleeding than could be endured without great injury in the
preceding constitution, and the blood was sizey. Both these patients had
a crisis of the fever by a large hæmorrhage from the right nostril on the
seventh day, and very nearly about the same hour in which they were first
seized. In one of them the hæmorrhage was accompanied by a diarrhœa, and
about a fortnight after he had a regular tertian.

In _January_ several old people had apoplexies, though few proved mortal:
they commonly ended in hemiplegias, which in several, though much
advanced in years, gave way to medicine.

About the 20th of _February_, the continual fever above mentioned, which
had almost totally ceased upon the setting in of cold weather, again made
its appearance, and with additional force. Almost all now had petechiæ,
which were round, very small, and of a purple colour. These, after the
twelfth or thirteenth day, disappeared, without any manifest alteration
in the disease. The urine during the first three or four days was of an
orange colour, and towards the seventh let fall a copious white sediment;
after that it became clear and pale as water till the eleventh or
twelfth; when, though it still retained the same appearance whilst warm,
when cold it let fall a sediment like fine flour, and continued thus till
the end of the disease, which always happened on the seventeenth.

Many of the sick in the fever, both of this and the last year, voided
many worms of the round kind, and towards the height of the disease
almost all were deaf, which last was a good sign; and it may here be
remarked, that these two symptoms are almost common to all fevers in
_Aleppo_.

About the middle of _April_ near one fourth of the people were seized
with violent coughs, which did not either last long with those attacked,
or in the compass of a few days continued to spread any farther.

The _Jews_, who had hitherto kept pretty clear of the fever, though it
was now very common in the city, began to feel its effects severely very
soon after their feast, about the middle of _April_.

In _May_ several of the sick had a critical sweat on the seventh day,
preceded in some by an hæmorrhage from the nose; but all who had this
hæmorrhage, in about five or six days after, had a return of the fever,
which was more violent than at the first attack, and continued five days.
In several those relapses were accompanied with peripneumonic symptoms,
and required bleeding.

Children had hitherto escaped this disease; but in this month (_May_) a
considerable number of them, from nine years old and upwards, were seized
with it. The symptoms and duration were much the same as in adults; only
their most frequent complaint was of pains in the belly, and they voided
worms either by vomiting or stool, chiefly of the round kind.

The number of the sick was much diminished by the beginning of _June_,
and the fever quite disappeared before _July_.

The method pursued in the cure of the fever of last year was attended
with the same success in this; and evacuations after the seventh day, as
in the preceding, so likewise in the present, were always prejudicial,
and often fatal.

The summer-fever, commonly incident to young children in this country,
began this year in _June_, and continued through the summer as customary.

In _July_ a very few were seized with mild dysenteries, others with
intermittents, chiefly quartans; but neither of these distempers were so
frequent as to be termed epidemic.

The ophthalmias, which, according to custom, were epidemic in
_September_, had this particular from other years, that the inflammation
was chiefly external in the palpebræ.

Both this and last year furunculi were frequent on different parts of
the body, but more especially the fingers; in _November_, and part of
_December_, they often broke out in the armpits, but without any other
disorder.

A very few had pleurisies in _December_, and several died suddenly of
apoplexies about this time.

It should have been before observed, that the continual fever of this
year, particularly after the month of _February_, seldom affected one
person in a house, without going through two thirds of the family; but
it was rare to find two sick together, one being generally a few days
recovered before the other was taken ill.




CHAP. IV.

Of the PLAGUE.


SECT. I.

_Of the PLAGUE in General._

    All the facts mentioned in the notes are taken from old
    journals or letters written at the times they happened.

It is the common opinion of the inhabitants of _Aleppo_, that they are
visited with the plague about once in ten years, and that it is brought
thither from some neighbouring city, where it first makes its appearance,
as _Antab_, _Urfa_, _&c._ to the northward, or _Damascus_ to the
southward; from which last place it is generally alledged that the worst
plagues have been brought; though some assert that those which have come
from the northward have raged with the greatest violence.

With respect to the intervals between the returns of the plague, though
that of 1742 is an exception, yet the common opinion seems in some
measure to be founded on experience[493]. And it seems a fact pretty
well attested, that it never rages at _Aleppo_ without having first
visited some of the above mentioned places; though the first appearance
of all is, from what I have been able to learn, always in some town on
the coast of _Syria_[494]. If it first shews itself in _Sidon_, _Byroot_,
or _Tripoly_, _Damascus_ is usually the channel through which it comes to
_Aleppo_; but if in _Scanderoon_ or _Byass_, then it commonly passes by
way of _Antab_, _Killis_, _Urfa_, &c.

During the winter this disease is constantly moderate; as the spring
advances it grows more violent, it comes to its height in _June_,
decreases greatly in _July_, and certainly disappears in _August_; and
this seems to be the constant course of the plague at _Aleppo_: so that
none are ever seized with it in the months of _September_ and _October_,
even in such extraordinary instances as when it has made its appearance
for three years successively, as it did in 1742, 1743, and 1744[495].

A considerable difference is observable, both as to the mortality and
number of the infected, in different years; but it does not appear that
it has ever raged in this country with the violence that it has often
done in _Europe_.

Extreme heat seems to check the progress of the distemper; for though,
during the few first hot days, the mortality, as well as the number of
those newly infected, encreased, yet a few days longer continuance of
that weather greatly diminished the number of the sick. Add to this, that
the season wherein it always ceases at _Aleppo_, is that in which the
heats are the most excessive.

Though the natives, as well as several authors, have a notion that the
moon has some influence over this distemper, yet experience no ways
favoured this opinion in the late plague at _Aleppo_.

Having the distemper once, does not prevent a second seizure, numbers
of people being alive when I left _Aleppo_, who have had it twice or
oftener; and I have even seen instances of the same person’s having had
the disease three several times in the same season.


SECT. II.

_Of the Plague, as it appeared in ~Aleppo~, in 1742, 1743, and 1744._

It is no wonder that the very name of _plague_ among us should strike
terror whenever it is mentioned; for, besides the numerous and terrible
distresses of the whole body of the people during the rage of a
pestilence, and the scenes of death and misery which are continually
before our eyes, the distemper itself is the most lamentable to which
mankind are liable. The torments of heat, thirst, and pain, frequently
unite in some patients; an unspeakable languor and dejection in others;
the loathsome remains of the distemper in the painful and putrid ulcers,
even in those who escape; the desertion of friends and attendants; the
want of common necessaries, and medical assistance, are all of them
circumstances which aggravate the miseries of the sick, and contribute
not a little towards augmenting the general horror.

And as there is no disease incident to mankind that is in its nature more
terrible and destructive, so there is none more difficult to describe.
Its symptoms are scarcely in all respects alike in any two persons; nay,
they even vary extremely in an hour in the same subject. The disease
begins often with the most flattering appearances, and ends fatally in
a few hours. Some complain of a pain at their heart, are seized with a
vomiting and giddiness, and die in a few minutes; while the most alarming
attacks sometimes end speedily in health and security.

In general, however, a coldness or shivering, with sickness, vomiting
large quantities of porraceous bile, often of a very offensive smell,
pain in the back or loins, an intense headach, uncommon giddiness, and
a sudden loss of strength, were the first complaints of those who were
seized with this distemper; and these were usually attended with great
uneasiness or anxiety about the pit of the stomach, and a sharp, shooting
pain darting into the parotid, axillary, or inguinal glands.

These symptoms were soon succeeded by a violent fever; in which, while
the patients complained of extreme inward heat, their skin felt but
little hotter than usual. Sometimes this heat soon became general and
intense, at other times particular parts only were affected therewith;
and it seldom continued many hours together alike, but remitted and
returned with considerable, but unequal force several times in a day.
The face, in these exacerbations, became florid, and was often changed
from a deep scarlet to a livid colour, resembling that of a person
almost strangled. These appearances again would suddenly give place to a
cadaverous paleness. The eyes soon lost their lustre, and acquired a kind
of muddiness; and the countenance of the greatest part of the sick was
ghastly, and confused beyond description.

The pulse, at the first seizure, was very little different from its
natural state, only somewhat more quick and low. In a few hours it
commonly encreased in quickness and strength; but these seldom continued
in the same way an hour together, nay, scarce many minutes, but varied
without any manifest correspondence with the other febrile symptoms, both
as to strength and quickness, incessantly.

In those who complained of pains, either darting into the parotids,
the armpits, or groins, a small, painful, hard, deep-seated tumor was
discovered by the touch in the part, without any manifest discoloration
of the skin. Such were the first beginnings of the pestilential _buboes_.

This was the common appearance of the distemper the first day of the
disease; and those who had the most favourable escape were often attacked
at first with as alarming symptoms as those who died in a few hours; for
sometimes this febrile paroxysm dissolved in a few hours, and left the
patient indeed languid, and weakened to an extreme degree, but free from
other complaints, except the pain of the tumor above mentioned; which in
many encreased from this time, both in size, tension, and pain, during
about twelve or fifteen days, when it commonly suppurated, the patient,
all the time, the first day excepted, walking about as usual.

But though many thus escaped, yet several who were seized in this manner,
especially in the month of _March_ 1743, suddenly dropped down dead, or
at least lived but a few hours; the headach, vomiting, and pain about
the præcordia, encreasing every moment to such a degree as to occasion
immediate death, or fatal convulsions. Few of those who died in this
manner had any appearance of such indurated tumors, though generally
the armpits, groins, or internal parts of the arms and thighs, were
livid or black, and the whole body was covered with confluent petechiæ,
interspersed with livid pustules, especially after death.

Those who survived the first attack of the distemper, which was by much
the greatest part of the sick, in the evening had a very considerable
encrease of every symptom. The heat became excessive, both internally
and externally; and as the sick were by this time for the most part
delirious, it was often with difficulty they could be kept within doors.
They were disposed to talk a great deal, but faultered so much in their
speech as scarcely to be understood; the tongue having also shared in the
debility that was evident in every other part of the body.

In this state they continued during most part of the night; towards
morning the violence of the heat, inquietude, and delirium, abated; a
manifest remission succeeded; some recovered their senses entirely, some
in great part, and then complained much of intense headach, or pain of
the buboes, which last would often increase suddenly, and decrease as
quickly, in the space of a few hours. About one half of the sick about
this time had an additional complaint of a painful pustule, like an
angry, confluent pock, surrounded by a circle of a deep scarlet tinge,
which soon became livid, and was attended with an intense burning pain;
from which circumstance, as well as from its fiery aspect, it has
probably obtained the name of _carbuncle_.

These pustules broke out indiscriminately on all parts of the body, and
increased from the size of a large pock to the extent of an inch and a
half diameter, sometimes, though rarely, to three inches.

The remission of the feverish symptoms was commonly but of very short
continuance, the rigors, anxiety, and delirium soon returning with
greater violence, with a frequent and strong _subsultus tendinum_. These
symptoms, however, did not proceed with a regular increase during the
day; but the rigors and heats coming and going by turns, formed short,
but alarming intermissions, each paroxysm surpassing the former either
in violence or duration; till, in the evening, the pulse was scarcely to
be counted by reason of its depression and quickness. The patient grew
comatose, with a quick, laborious, and interrupted respiration.

The buboes, which some hours before seemed manifestly to increase, now
often subsided, and almost disappeared, and the livid circle about the
carbuncle became black, resembling a large eschar made by a caustic; and
livid or black spots, of different dimensions, about this time often
appeared dispersed over the whole body.

Under these circumstances, dreadful as they seemed, some hope of recovery
still remained; for though many died on the third day, yet several had
a favourable crisis by a profuse sweat: some struggled under these
difficulties to the fifth day, a few to the seventh, and here and there
one even to the eleventh, before any critical alteration appeared.

If the disease was not wholly carried off by a copious sweat on the
third day, it was always considerably abated, and was in general totally
removed by a second, though less profuse one, by the fifth; so that no
symptoms of the disease were then left, weakness excepted, and the pain
proceeding from the buboes and carbuncles. And it may here be remarked,
that all who were attacked had buboes; though, even in many that
recovered, they discussed without any manner of bad consequences: but the
carbuncles did not appear on above one half of the sick, and often begun
to digest before the critical sweat happened.

It is evident, from the account already given, that nothing could be more
difficult than to form a judgment about the event of this disease, or be
more just than what _Morellus_[496] observes on a similar occasion. This
author, after reciting several circumstances proving the irregularity of
its type, concludes, “That, in respect to the plague, even our senses
and reason deceive us, the aphorisms of _Hippocrates_ are erroneous; and
_Hippocrates_ himself, was he present, would likewise be mistaken.”

The tongue was in some quite moist, and in all respects like that of a
person in health through the whole course of the distemper; in others
it was at first white, but soon became yellow, black, and covered
with a dry, rough scurf or fur. Some had no thirst at all, and could
scarcely be prevailed upon to take liquids in sufficient quantities.
But the generality of the sick were extremely thirsty, and drank with
great eagerness whatever they had given them, especially at particular
times; for the intenseness of their thirst had irregular intervals, and
did not continue alike through the progress of the distemper, nor often
correspond with the violence of the fever.

In most patients the vomiting ceased after the first few hours, excepting
when they overloaded their stomachs during this excess of thirst; at
which times the vomiting returned.

The urine was as little to be depended on as a sign as any other
circumstance, being scarce alike at the same time of the disease in any
two persons; and its appearance varied no less in the same patient every
day. In general, however, it was somewhat of a deeper yellow than usual
in a person in health, and without sediment.

Some had a diarrhœa during all the time, others were costive; in most the
discharges were natural. The distemper, however, seemed never to admit of
a critical solution by either stool or urine. Some few had hæmorrhages
from the nose or uterus: and if these happened after the second day,
a plentiful sweat, which was most commonly critical, soon followed; a
circumstance different from what usually has happened in the plague at
other places.

In the years 1742 and 1743, the buboes often appeared as soon as the
patients were taken ill, in some not till twelve hours after, and in a
few not till after two or three days: but, in 1744, some perceived the
buboes a day or two before they had any other symptom of the disease. And
during all the time the plague raged at _Aleppo_, none of the sick were
without them, except such who died suddenly. In general, the sick had but
one, and they were more common in the axillary or inguinal glands than
in the parotids. Some few had even two or three, which were not confined
to one side of the body. Their first appearance, as hath been mentioned,
was like a small indurated gland; deeply seated; in some they were fixed
but more frequently moveable, and most commonly painful to the touch.
They would often, increase considerably in a few hours with intense
pain, and would as suddenly subside; and these changes would frequently
succeed each other several times in twenty-four hours. Sometimes an
exacerbation immediately following the decrease of the bubo, would prompt
one to imagine this decrease to have been the cause; but this was not so
constantly the case as to induce me to think it was so in reality.

The buboes, so far as I could learn, never advanced towards a regular
maturation, till a critical sweat had carried off the fever. In ten,
twelve, or fifteen days from the first attack, they commonly suppurated
with the usual attendants of heat and pain. Sometimes, nay frequently, I
have known them to disappear soon after the critical sweat, and discuss
without any detriment to the patient. At other times, when grown pretty
large, about the height of the disease, they sunk, and mortified without
being attended with fatal consequences: for as soon as the crisis was
compleat, the mortification stopped, and the eschar separated gradually,
leaving a large deep ulcer, which healed without difficulty by the usual
methods.

The inguinal buboes were seldom single, there being generally two, and in
the same groin. The superior was the largest, of a long figure, somewhat
resembling a cucumber, lying obliquely, but lower than where the venereal
buboes appear, and it was this which commonly came to suppuration. Once I
met with a case where an axillary bubo divided into two; one part getting
under the pectoral muscle, the other sinking deeper into the armpit:
both of them grew painful and inflamed; but that in the armpit only
suppurated.

I met with no instance of a bubo not followed or preceded by the fever.

In respect to the carbuncles, it has already been observed, that
they broke out on all parts of the body, the muscular and tendinous
especially. From the size of a silver penny they often spread themselves
speedily to the extent of an inch and half, two inches, nay sometimes
three inches, diameter, frequently penetrating deep into the substance
of the parts they attacked. Their most common time of appearing was on
the second day of the disease. Their progress was very quick, and not
above one half of the sick had them. In such as died, I was told, (for I
saw none of those cases myself) that from the pustule issued a quantity
of ichorous matter; but the black circle remained hard and dry; in the
others the mortification usually stopped on the third day, and in a
day or two more digested, and began to separate round the edges. The
separation of the whole eschar was completed rather sooner than in such
as are made by a caustic.

A few of the sick had pustules, which were filled with well-concocted
matter, without any livid or discoloured circle about them: these,
after a certain time, dried up, and fell off, as it commonly happens in
the distinct small-pox; and as all the patients who had this eruption
recovered, it was considered as a favourable symptom.

To enumerate all the various changes that happened, with the sudden and
unexpected transitions from extreme danger to great safety, would be
tedious, and little instructive. Such, however, were the general outlines
of the distemper, and the most usual symptoms; which though they by no
means furnish one with the necessary helps to form a certain prognostic,
yet some hints may from thence be deduced for establishing a rational,
and perhaps a successful practice.

Upon considering, however, the several circumstances attending this
fatal distemper, the various shapes it assumes, the sudden transitions
from one appearance to another, the precipitate advances to its
height, and the danger which the physician incurs in visiting the
sick, the wonder ceases, that we meet with in authors so various and
contradictory accounts of the proper methods for treating it. Some plead
for evacuations, others decry them with vehemence: if we allow, that
difference of climates, different constitutions of the air in the same
climate, and perhaps some variety even in the plague itself, might lead
practitioners to judge not always alike concerning it; yet it is not so
easy to reconcile the jarring opinions of those who have practised at
the same time, and in the same place, in respect to this essential part
of management: and as in a disease, wherein reason is often perplexed,
and experience itself fallacious, one would chuse to rely much on proper
authority, it is greatly to be lamented, that nature has not been more,
and opinion less, attended to. As the plague has so often visited that
country, one might reasonably have expected among the natives some
vestiges of unbiassed observation, and attempts at least towards a proper
method of cure; but, so far as I have hitherto been able to discover,
no traces of any thing satisfactory are to be met with among them. The
_Turks_ have less faith in medicine for the cure of this disease than
of any other, believing it to be a curse inflicted by God Almighty for
the sins of the people; and as the chief of those who practise physic
are either _Christians_ or _Jews_, and not so strongly prepossessed
with the doctrine of predestination, consequently afraid of catching
the distemper, they rather endeavour to confirm the _Turks_ in their
false notions, lest they should be forced to visit the sick. Hence it
follows, that the greatest part of those who are seized with the plague,
either are left to struggle with the violence of the disorder without
any assistance, or must submit to the direction of the meanest and most
ignorant of mankind. The practice which seems to prevail most generally
amongst them, is to bleed all who apply to them, and in every stage of
the disease; after which they endeavour to promote sweat by a few grains
of bezoar, in the simple distilled water of scorzonera; which is the
medicine they chiefly confide in, such is the slender acquaintance they
have yet acquired in the _materia medica_.

From the most impartial and attentive observation I could make, it
seemed to me, that very plentiful bleeding at the first appearance of
the disease was of great service; but after the first day was always
prejudicial.

Vomiting was also of the utmost consequence at the beginning: warm water
was commonly sufficient to procure it, as the sick had generally a
propensity to this discharge. If a stimulus was required, a small dose
of _ipecacuanha_ or _sal vitrioli_ was all that was necessary for most
patients.

Though purging with the violent cathartics is justly condemned; yet
an emollient glyster, or even a gentle laxative with manna and _crem.
tartar._ when the patient was costive, and the head much affected, was
not only safe, but often of great service; and, when the symptoms were
not violent, I have frequently given a gentle purge of _infus. sennæ,
mann. & crem. tartar._ the second day of the disease with success. It may
appear strange; but it is a fact confirmed to me by many instances, that
a purgative of this kind, given after the critical sweat, was the most
effectual means to bring the buboes to suppuration.

The natural crisis of the disease was always by sweat; and, when the same
evacuation could be procured by art, it was also of service; but there
were two great inconveniences attending attempts of this kind on the
first day. One was, that the common medicines in the usual doses for this
purpose, if they failed of procuring the desired diaphoresis, threw the
patient into a flame, and greatly augmented all the symptoms: the other
inconvenience was, that though we succeeded in raising a sweat, it was
requisite to continue it a much longer time than most of the people in
that country could be persuaded to endure; and, if checked, it was of bad
consequence, either increasing all the symptoms, or, what was often the
case, bringing on a diarrhœa; which though at first it seemed to relieve,
yet generally proved fatal in the end.

The cordial and diaphoretic medicines found to be most efficacious were,
_Rad. contrayerv._ _Valerian. sylvest._ _Croc. Anglic._ _Pulv. contrayerv.
comp. Pharm. Edin._ and _Theriac. Androm._ or _Diascord._ when a diarrhœa
attended. Anodynes also greatly assisted the other medicines in their
operations; but those of the gentler kind, as _syr. diacod._ seemed to
agree better with the sick than opium.

I made an attempt to try the effects of the cortex in this distemper; but
a popular clamour being raised against that medicine, I thought it most
prudent to desist, as I was convinced that my youth, and the short time
I had then resided in the place, would render any efforts I could make
to get the better of it ineffectual. No fair trial was made of the _rad.
serpentar. Virgin._ because few of the natives would take it on account
of its bitterness: for whoever would obtain a ready compliance with his
orders in that country, must as seldom as possible offend their palates
with unpleasant remedies; because whatever may be the consequence to
themselves, they will often chuse to incur distant, though great risks,
rather than submit to present inconveniences. Small doses repeated every
four hours, was the most effectual method of giving these medicines, and
plenty of diluent liquors, acidulated with spirit of vitriol, not only
assisted in promoting a diaphoresis, but was of the utmost consequence in
moderating the fever, which the cordials and diaphoretics were otherwise
apt to increase.

Nitrous medicines in this disease neither were attended with their usual
success in allaying heat, nor could the sick in general bear the common
doses without a sensible increase of languor and dejection, or danger of
bringing on a diarrhœa.

The following method of treating the sick I found the most successful
upon repeated trials.

As soon as the patient was seized, from 10 to 20 ounces of blood,
according to the present condition of the sick, or violence of the
symptoms, were ordered to be taken from the arm. Seldom more than a pound
however was taken from any; that being a quantity greatly exceeding what
they usually lose at once in any disease.

After bleeding, if the nausea was considerable, they were ordered to
drink plentifully of warm water, (which was presently brought up again,
and with it a quantity of bile), and this operation to be repeated
several times. If the nausea was not sufficient, which was but seldom
the case, a small dose of _rad. ipecacuan._ or _sal. vitriol._ was given
to promote the vomiting. It appeared from experience of such consequence
that those evacuations should be made early, that most of my acquaintance
had previous directions to set about them immediately, in case any
person should be infected in their family.

A gentle anodyne was given after vomiting, or, if that did not
settle their stomachs, _Riverius_’s saline draught, with an ounce of
_diacodium_, or 15 drops of _laudanum_.

These evacuations being premised, small doses of the cordial and
diaphoretic medicines, above mentioned, joined with a very small
proportion of _nitr. stibiat._ were given every four hours; and the sick
were encouraged to drink liberally of a decoction of scorzonera roots
and barley, or even of spring water, but always tepid, if they could be
persuaded to drink it so, and acidulated with as much _sp. vitrioli_, as
to make it agreeable. A certain proportion of this spirit, with syrup of
violets, made it more grateful both to the eye and the palate, and was no
small inducement to them to drink the necessary quantity.

In the winter, the sick were ordered to be removed into a larger and more
airy room, than they were accustomed to sleep in at that season; and the
air to be both warmed and corrected by a moderate fire. In the summer,
all the doors and windows were allowed to be opened, excepting that which
was immediately opposite to the patient’s bed; and many of them would
not even bear that restriction, but would have all open in the day time,
and often in the night lay upon the house top. Their covering was the
same as in health.

A moderate cordial of some of the simple waters, with a little _Tinct.
croci_, _Tinct. Valerian_, _sylv. Confect. alkerm._ well acidulated with
_sp. vitrioli_, and commonly sweetened with syrup of white poppies, was
allowed them when faint or uneasy, and they expressed great satisfaction
upon taking this mixture. For children, this alone, with plenty of
acidulated liquors, was what I chiefly used, and with good success.

When the sick could be persuaded to submit to the above regimen, a sweat
often broke out the second or beginning of the third day, when they were
covered up, and the sweat was encouraged so long as they could bear it.

Whether it proceeded from the carelessness of the attendants, in giving
way to the impatience of the sick, and so not encouraging the sweat
so long as it ought to have been, or from the nature of the disease,
I know not, but certain it is, that this first sweat, particularly if
it happened on the second day, though it greatly relieved the patient,
yet did not entirely carry off the fever. A continuance of the same
medicines, in somewhat larger doses, generally enabled nature to throw
off every subsequent exacerbation by a plentiful sweat, till a compleat
crisis was obtained.

When the sweat was sufficient, and had greatly mitigated the symptoms,
notwithstanding some degree of fever still remained, a mild cathartic was
given the next morning, the other medicines were continued during its
operation, and an anodyne was ordered early in the evening.

When an encrease of the symptoms seemed to be the consequence of a sudden
sinking of the buboes, which sometimes happened on the second or third
day, a blister applied just below the bubo was of service.

Upon the first appearance of a coma, or debility in the tongue, a blister
was applied to the head, and to the other usual parts, as necessity
required. Some patients, who had been deemed past recovery, having
struggled through the disease, and apparently by the use of blisters, at
length brought them into credit, and induced the natives to submit, with
less reluctance, to a practice which they would otherwise have abhorred.
Stimulating cataplasms of one part garlic, and two parts crum of bread,
with the addition of a little vinegar, applied to the soles of the feet,
were of great service in this case; and if the patient was costive,
emollient laxative glysters were injected. The dose of the alexipharmics
was encreased, and diluting acidulated liquors given often in small
quantities.

Suppurating cataplasms were sometimes applied to the buboes, but as they
were kept on with difficulty, the _Empl. Diachyl. cum Gum._ was more
generally used; and when a stimulus was required, a few cantharides, or a
little euphorbium was added. In most of the sick, they were left to open
of themselves, on account of the dread the natives have of the lancet
or caustic, and the want sometimes of proper persons to apply them: and
indeed, by what I observed, none suffered from the long delay in opening
them, farther than the usual inconveniences attending other tumors thus
left to themselves; and they never required any method different from the
common to heal them.

When the buboes mortified, they were treated as the carbuncles; and
though, upon the separation of the mortified parts, the ulcers were often
large and deep, yet they healed very soon.

Sometimes the carbuncles were scarified, but oftener not: the dressings
that agreed best with them, were _Ung. Basilic. Flav._ with a small
proportion of _Ol. Terebinthinæ_, and sometimes _Tinct. Myrrh._ applying
over all an emollient cataplasm; and after the indurated black parts were
separated, they soon healed, without any particular accidents.


SECT. III.

_Of the method used by the ~Europeans~ for their preservation from the
Plague._

Next to the protection of Divine Providence, the means that the
_Europeans_ at _Aleppo_ depend upon for their preservation during the
time of the plague, are either retiring from the city, or shutting up at
home, in such a manner as effectually to prevent all communication with
either persons or goods capable of conveying the infection. The first
method was formerly the common practice of the _English_, when the nature
of their business was such as allowed them to retire early in the season,
and their number so considerable, that they encamped upon the _Bylan_
mountains, without any danger from the _Curds_[497]: so that, by keeping
the person employed to go to the village to market at a proper distance,
and using the necessary precautions in receiving provisions, _&c._ if
the plague should be there, they were quite secure, and had at the same
time an opportunity of amusing themselves by riding, shooting, and other
country-recreations, and enjoying the cool air and verdure among those
mountains; a pleasure at other times surpassing most others in that warm
climate, though now barely sufficient to allay the melancholy reflexions
so natural on this occasion. At present, however, as the nature of
their business is such as prevents their retiring early, their number
small, and the _Curds_ more troublesome than heretofore, so that they
cannot well encamp upon the mountains, a retirement from the place is
attended with considerable inconveniences; for it is next to impossible,
when the season is advanced, but one or other of the servants who must
unavoidably be hired to carry baggage, _&c._ on the road, (for all sorts
of necessaries must be carried along with one in this country, even
provisions and bedding) either has the distemper in his own family, or at
best has daily intercourse with numbers in that condition. And though,
by carrying tents, the danger of sleeping in an infected village may be
avoided; yet it may nevertheless happen to be at the very place where
the retirement has been intended, it being, I believe, very rare that it
rages at _Aleppo_ without likewise affecting most other places within a
few days journey round it, and full as rare that the people will confess
its being amongst them.

Shutting up at home is attended with none of these inconveniences, and,
when conducted in the proper manner, its salutary effects are found by
experience to be such, that persons in this situation remain without
danger in the middle of a city where the plague rages with the greatest
violence; a circumstance so evident, that all the _Christians_ and _Jews_
who can afford it follow the example of the _Franks_ in this respect.
And though the _Turks_ cannot, on account of their religion, do it
avowedly[498]; yet such of them as have been any ways conversant with the
_Europeans_, and are not mere bigots, either keep at home, on pretence of
being indisposed, or retire to some garden for change of air, if their
affairs will not admit of their going abroad to some distant place,
where they imagine the disease does not reach. A journey to _Mecca_, on
pretence of devotion, is their most common expedient.

It having been mentioned, that the _Europeans_ are not so subject to
the epidemic diseases of that country as the natives, it is necessary
to inform the reader, that experience confirms their being liable to
the plague, some of them having generally been infected when the
distemper raged in the place, either before they shut up, or after they
came abroad. It may also be proper to add, that their servants, who are
natives, and are a much greater number than the _Europeans_, enjoy the
same benefit from shutting up.

While the number of the sick is inconsiderable, as is commonly the
case during the winter, the _Europeans_ content themselves with using
the following precautions, _viz._ to have no more intercourse with the
natives than what they are necessarily obliged to by their business; to
keep their servants at home, if possible, which however is not easily
accomplished; not to make use of a common barber, if it can be avoided;
and to carefully enquire concerning the health of those who wash their
linen, chusing for that office such as are not employed by the natives.
This does not however prevent their visiting each other, and enjoying
their usual recreations abroad in the country.

During this time it is usual for the natives to make use of all the
arguments in their power to persuade the _Europeans_, that either the
whole of the reports concerning the distemper are false, or, when this
cannot be accomplished, that the little which had appeared is now quite
over; which last pretence, however untrue, or indeed vain to hope for,
many are willing to be deceived by, till either some _European_, their
dependants, or others under their immediate inspection, being infected,
causes a general consternation, and occasions their shutting up with
all expedition. Such of the _Franks_ as act with the most prudence not
only use the precautions already mentioned, but also make the proper
dispositions for shutting up, so as to be ready to do it upon the first
visible increase of the distemper, which they look upon as unavoidable in
the spring, and lay their account with being confined till _July_. The
progress of the disease is so quick, that the difference between such as
shut up early, and those that brave it out to the last, is seldom more
than a few days.

As it would be disagreeable for a single person to be confined by
himself, they generally divide into small parties, and shut up in such
houses as are most spacious and convenient. It is an advantage to be in
one that has no communication, by way of the terrace, with any other;
for though when the distemper is not frequent, going over the house-top
to visit such other of their friends as are also shut up, is sometimes
practised, yet, when the plague rages much, it is reckoned safest not to
trust to any one, lest they should be guilty of irregularities; and when
such communications are open, it is impossible to be sure of keeping the
servants in order. Provision is made, as has been already mentioned, for
a confinement till _July_; for, after the doors are once shut, nothing
is admitted but letters, and what is absolutely necessary for the table,
and these too with the precautions which shall be mentioned. One thing,
though it may seem trifling, conduces not a little to their ease, and
that is, to have one person that can shave; for a long beard is extremely
disagreeable in hot weather. Cats, being great ramblers, are looked upon
as dangerous animals at such times; and therefore the _Europeans_ either
confine theirs at home, or send them to be taken care of by some of their
dependants, in a distant part of the city; and no quarter is shewn to any
strange cats that shall happen to be seen within their bounds, but such
are immediately shot, and thrown into the street by the help of a pair of
tongs.

This disposition being made, and the distemper so far advanced that it
is thought imprudent to go abroad any longer, the street-door is locked,
and, for the greater security, sealed up; and, if there are any windows,
or passages of any kind below stairs, through which the servants might
possibly receive any thing from without, they are secured also; even the
small hole cut in the door through which the water, for the service of
the family is conveyed, has a lock and key, so that it is never opened,
but when the Sacka (or water-carrier) comes, and then usually one of
the _Europeans_ attends; for these water-carriers, being of the same
race with the servants, are the most likely to bring them such things as
they may desire. A window above stairs is next allotted, through which
the necessary provisions, _&c._ are to be received; and such an one
is usually chose as looks into the most private part of the Khane, or
street, to avoid drawing together a concourse of idle passengers, which
the novelty of the sight would naturally do: but the more this window is
exposed to the eyes of the family within, the better it is for preventing
irregularities from servants. The necessary apparatus for this window,
consists of a rope, which, with the addition of a few yards of an iron
chain, and a hook to the lower end, reaches within two or three feet of
the ground; an iron or copper pail, which is hung on the hook of the
chain, and let down for conveying things to or from a person below, whom
they hire on purpose, and is all day in waiting to bring the necessary
provisions, carry messages, _&c._ A quantity of vinegar, a pail of water,
a long reed split at one end for conveying letters, and some brimstone to
smoke them with, as also a pair of tongs for taking out the provisions.
Meat, poultry (which last must be well picked) and every thing else that
will allow of it, is dipped in water, mixed with a small proportion of
vinegar, and hung up some little time before it is touched. Bread, which
will admit of nothing of that nature, is exposed to the air for some
hours before it is handled; and letters or other papers, are sprinkled
with vinegar and smoked with sulphur; for which purpose, if it was a
more general practice to have a box so contrived, as to impregnate the
papers more throughly with the fumes of that mineral, it might perhaps
be more safe. Some few, in place of sulphur, smoke their letters with
the following, which is what is commonly used in the Lazaretto at
_Malta_[499].

The impatience under confinement, with the melancholy occasion of it, the
apprehension that some of the company may have received the infection,
though it may not as yet have appeared, the singing before the corps in
the day, and the shrieking of the women for the dead, both day and night,
all contribute to make the first week’s confinement very disagreeable.
Custom, however, soon renders those things so familiar, as to lose much
of their force; and the company falling into various ways of amusing
themselves, in a very little time, though they cannot help feeling for
the unhappy sufferers, yet the only uneasiness most people express, on
their own account, is from a want of liberty to go abroad; this want,
they endeavour to supply by an evening’s walk upon the house-top, from
whence as many of the _European_ houses are but at a small distance from
each other, they enjoy the conversation of some of their friends, though
too far off for secrecy.

Though the shutting up of the _Europeans_ and many _Christians_, as also
the retirement of some _Turks_, as has been already mentioned, in a great
measure puts a stop to trade while the distemper rages violently, yet
the markets are all open, and as great plenty of provisions, and every
thing else to be had as at any other time: the streets too, though not so
much crouded, yet are still pretty full of people; the generality of the
_Turks_ visit the sick, and attend their funerals, in the same manner as
at other times; and though the _Christians_ and _Jews_ do not, except on
very emergent occasions, visit their sick friends, and very few besides a
priest, and those who carry the bier, attend the funerals, yet there is
no want of servants and relations, to do the necessary offices about the
sick, the same as if it was any common distemper.

As soon as the number of the sick begins to decline, the same causes that
prevented some from shutting up early, together with a natural desire
that all have for liberty, generally induces several to get abroad too
soon. The difference between the first and the last, in opening as in
shutting up, seldom exceeds a few days; and yet this, however, makes a
very considerable one in the risk, for both the increase and decrease of
the distemper, are very sudden.

The first step upon opening, is usually to ride abroad; and though it
is at a season wherein there is not the least verdure, except in the
gardens, yet, after so long a confinement, the sight of the open country
affords no small pleasure. Care is taken, while the gentlemen are abroad,
to prevent the servants in the family from having intercourse with any
body; and, after the doors are opened, the same precautions are used for
a week or two, as before shutting up.

The above precautions, are all that the _Europeans_ commonly practise;
but by myself, and such of the natives, who being obliged to be amongst
the sick, asked my advice, the following rules were observed, which,
though nothing new, I have taken the liberty to insert; as they have
hitherto proved successful, and many of them may be useful to the
_Europeans_, while their business obliges them to go abroad: to this,
however, it is but justice to add, that the trials were not many, and
that there were some few persons who were equally in the way of the
disease, without being infected, though they used no precautions at all.
The rules laid down were these:

Never to go abroad in the morning fasting.

To avoid, as much as possible, all excesses, violent passions, or large
evacuations, but not to live more abstemiously, either with regard to
eating or drinking, than usual: perhaps one or two glasses of good wine
more than customary, might rather be beneficial than otherwise; and a
plentiful use of acid liquors, such as a very weak sour punch in the
summer, is not only agreeable but useful.

While in the sick person’s chamber, passing a corpse, or near any thing
infected, not to swallow the saliva, and to breathe, in the natural way
through a handkerchief or spunge, wetted either with plain vinegar, or
such as had rue infused in it.

When examining the pulse, and other circumstances that require being very
nigh the sick, to hold the breath as much as possible, and, as soon as
retired from the chamber, to wash the mouth, face, and hands with vinegar.

Upon returning home, to put on other cloaths, and expose such as had been
wore to the air; perhaps it might also be of service to smoke them with
sulphur, but this was not practised. At such times also, it is proper
once more to wash the mouth, face, and hands with vinegar.

As to medicine, a large dose of the extract of the bark, with a draught
of wine and water, well acidulated with elixir of vitriol, taken twice a
day, were all that were used. For such as can take the bark in a liquid
form, a strong decoction of it may answer the purpose as effectually.


SECT. IV.

Of the MAL d’ALEPPO.

A Cutaneous disease, thought by some to be peculiar to this place, has
acquired the name of _Il mal d’Aleppo_, or _Aleppo evil_, among the
_Europeans_. The natives call it _Habt il senne_, or _Botch of a year_,
from the supposed time of its duration. In _Turkish_, _Haleb Choban_, or
_the Aleppo ulcer_. This disease is not, however, peculiar to this place,
being almost as common at _Antab_, and all the other villages on the
banks of the rivers _Sejour_ and _Coick_, as at this place; which favours
the opinion of its being occasioned by the water.

The natives reckon but two species of this disorder, and distinguish them
by the names of male and female; but there is a third kind of cutaneous
distemper, which, though it is commonly ascribed to the bite or sting of
a common millepedes, or wood-louse, seems to me to be altogether of the
same nature, though milder in degree.

What they call the male distemper, makes its appearance in the form of a
small, red, hard tubercle or pimple, which commonly passes some weeks
unregarded, as it gives no manner of uneasiness: afterwards it begins to
encrease, and usually comes to the size of an _English_ sixpence, which,
after some months, begins to be scurfy on the top; by degrees the little
matter that oozes out of it, forms into a thick crusty scab; which,
unless it is picked off, or otherwise disturbed, remains upon it till the
parts underneath being healed, it falls off, and leaves but a very small
mark. The whole of its duration is seldom above eight months.

What is called the female species begins like the former; but after a
month or two it becomes somewhat painful, encreases often to double
the extent of the male, discharges a good deal of the ichorous matter
from under the scab, and by degrees comes to have the appearance of an
indigested scorbutic ulcer, with a livid circle round it; but seems to be
no deeper than the _tunica cellulosa_. In this condition it remains for
several months, and is in general about a year from its first appearance
before it is cured: but this is not a thing certain, many getting well
some months sooner, while others remain several months longer. After it
is cicatrised, it leaves an ugly scar, which remains thro’ life, and for
many months has a livid colour. When they are not irritated, they seldom
give much pain.

The third kind of _Mal_, which they call the pinch of a millepedes,
begins like the two others, but seldom grows larger than about twice the
size of a large pin’s head, and never changes its appearance, remaining a
small tubercle for many months, without any pain, after which, it usually
throws off a few scurfy scales and disappears; but some remain a much
longer time.

It affects the natives when they are children, and generally appears in
the face, though they also have some on their extremities; for most of
them have two, three, or sometimes more, it being rare that they have but
one. In strangers, it commonly appears some months after their arrival;
and they have them not so frequently on the face as the natives: very few
escape having them, but they seldom affect the same person above once;
dogs and cats are as subject to the disease as men; it commonly breaks
out upon the nose of these creatures.

In respect to the cure, like the tooth-ach, or ague with us, every
one pretends to an infallible remedy for them; but the many beautiful
faces, daily impaired by the disease, are too evident proofs of their
ill success: and in truth, from what I have observed, it is infinitely
better to apply nothing, than any of the numberless medicines they make
use of.

Of several applications that I made trial of upon myself and some others,
I found the mercurial plaister the most efficacious; the prescription
was the same as the _Emplastrum commune cum mercurio_, with a smaller
proportion of mercury, and a little larger of _Bals. sulphur._

If this was applied at the beginning, it often prevented their making
any farther progress; if they had begun to run, it hindered them from
increasing so much as they would otherwise have done, and generally cured
them before their usual time. This is to be understood of that called
the female; for the male, as well as the third kind, seldom require any
medicinal application.

The reader, it is hoped, is now no longer a stranger to most of the
particulars relating to _Aleppo_; but I cannot conclude these sheets,
without rendering justice to their natural patrons, the gentlemen
of the _British_ factory there, who still maintain that excellent
character, for which they have been long celebrated, of mitigating the
inconveniences that necessarily attend their residence in that city, by
the perfect harmony in which they live, and improving every circumstance
of advantage by the same social quality, of which, having been so long
witness, and in which being so much a partaker, I make no doubt, the
public will receive with candor, this testimony which gratitude requires.

[334] A rotoloe of _Aleppo_ is five pounds.

[335] Leban is a coagulated sour milk, usually prepared by boiling the
milk, and, when hot, putting a small proportion of leban into it, which
coagulates the whole before next morning. How it was made originally,
I could never learn, the natives never using any other than the above
method: but, from some experiments which I have been told were made,
it would appear, that by first letting some milk stand till sour, then
putting a little of it to some fresh milk, which it will turn also, next
day repeating the same with this new-turned milk, and so continuing for a
number of days, one may at last produce the true leban.

[336] I dissected a male of this species, which was shot a few hours
from the city. It was a little bigger than a large mastiff-dog, which
it resembled in many respects. Its colour was grey, and streaked
transversely with black; the hair harsh, and somewhat longer than that
of a dog; and from the hind-part of the head, down the neck and back, it
had a long white mane, as described by Aristotle[A]. The opinion of
this animal’s being incapable of moving the neck, _&c._[B], is without
foundation, it having vertebræ, and as easy a motion of the head as
dogs, or other animals of that species. I could not observe any thing in
the eye particular when dead: however, as I saw it not alive, I cannot
contradict what Pliny says, _Oculis mille esse varietates colorumque
mutationes_. Just over the anus was an aperture, which at first sight
appeared like a female pudendum, but proved on examination only a shallow
kind of sack. Its use I could not find out: but this seems to have given
rise to what the ancients report of this animal, and what the natives of
this country still believe, _viz._ that it changes its sex every year.
The penis differed from that of a dog, in having no bone. The scrotum was
but small, and at first sight seemed to contain but one testicle, the
other being close bound up by the skin, so as not to appear externally.
The vasa præparantia and deferentia were traced from the testicle through
the rings of the muscles; but they were unfortunately cut out with the
entrails, which the person who killed the animal had thrown away for the
lighter carriage.

[355] The kata (See plate IX.) is about the size of a partridge, and its
shape between that and a pigeon. The bill is of a light colour, tipp’d
with black, short, and thick; the legs white, covered with short feathers
on the fore-part; three toes stand forward, and a small spur behind.
There is a good deal of variety in their plumage. The bird now described
is one of the most beautiful. Round the eyes, and the fore-part of the
neck (except under the throat, where it is black), the feathers are of
a bright colour; the tips being black, form a sort of ring on the upper
part of the breast, which is of a cinnamon colour, terminated at the
lower part by a ring of black, like the former. The belly is white. The
back, and that part of the wing next to it, is of a mouse-colour, with
most of the feathers tipp’d with a bright yellow. Of the same colour
is the tip of the pinnion; but the short feathers under it are broad,
and tipp’d with black, or a coffee-colour, with a narrow rim of white
at the very extremity, having the appearance of so many half-moons. The
long feathers of the wing are of a mouse-colour, with the quill black.
The feathers on the rump are agreeably variegated with black, white,
and yellow. The tail, which is short, like that of a pigeon, ends in
two long, very narrow, black feathers or quills, running out near three
inches beyond the others, and ending in a point. These birds are in such
plenty in the months mentioned in the text, that a whole ass-load has
often been taken at once shutting of a clasp-net.

[392] This bird is about the size and shape of a starling, and seems of
that species. The bill is short, and black; of which colour are also
the legs. The plumage on the body is of a flesh-colour: the head, neck,
wings, and tail, are black.

[414] See Plate X. where it is drawn with its neck stretched out, being
the common action of this bird. The length of the bird in this posture,
from the point of the bill to the end of the tail, is 15 inches; the
neck, from the setting on of the shoulders, 5½; the bill 2 inches; from
the tip of one wing to that of the other, when extended, 20½ inches. The
body of the bird is but small, about the size of a rail; and the colour
of the feathers resemble also those of that bird. The top of the head,
and tips of the wings, are black; the legs are long, of a greenish white
colour: the toes four. This bird is common on the river Coic near Aleppo.

[415] See Plate XI. The description is as follows. From the tip of the
bill to the end of the tail, 11½ inches; the breadth between the tips
of the extended wings 23 inches; weight of the bird 4 ounces. The bill
is somewhat more than an inch in length, the upper mandible being the
longest, and a very little crooked at the extremity. From the upper part
of the thigh to the extremity of the middle claw, is 7 inches. These long
legs are bare of feathers from the middle of the thigh, and black. The
claws are also black, three in number; of which the middle one is the
longest, and is joined by a membrane to the outer claw. This bird has no
back-claw.

The crown of the head is black; the neck white, except a streak of black,
which is continued from the chin to the breast. The breast, with the
greater part of the belly, is black; the feathers of the lower part of
the belly and the thighs white. The back is of a mouse-colour. The tail
is not forked, and about 4 inches in length; the half next to the body
white, the other half black[C]. The nine longest quill-feathers of the
wings are black; the others white, but black at the tips; so that the
whole lower part of the wing appears of that colour. The covert-feathers
are of the same colour with the back[D]. In the fore-part of each wing
is a little sharp, straight, blackish horn, like a cock’s spur; below
which for a little way the covert-feathers are white.

This bird is also found nigh the river Coic.

[C] The two outer feathers tipp’d with white.

[D] Seven of the outer covert-feathers black.

[422] The fish, Plate XII. No. 1. in its shape resembles very much the
Silurus Rondeletii, like it too having no scales. Its length (from the
nose to the tip of the tail) 20 inches, weight 20 ounces; but they are
of different sizes. The head and back are black: the lateral line runs
quite from the head to the tail, on the middle of the side; below which,
to the belly, the colour generally changes to a dark purple. Of the same
colour is the under-part of the head. The head is flat, and in length
near 5 inches; the body is round, till within a few inches of the tail,
where it grows flat. The mouth is not so large in proportion as that of
the silurus. It has no tongue; and the structure of the mouth and palate
agree exactly with the description of that fish. From the edge of the
nostril on each side arises a small cirrus, and from the angles of the
mouth two others, that are stronger, and twice as long. On the lower lip
are four more, the two external being the longest. The eyes are situated
near the corner of the mouth, close upon the inferior edge of the upper
jaw. The branchiæ are four on each side; and all of them have a double
row of sharp points, like the teeth of a comb. It has two fins near
the branchiæ, consisting of seven radii; to the anterior part of which
joins a pretty strong prickly bone. About an inch above the anus are two
smaller fins. A long fin extends from under the anus to the tail, as
another of the same kind does from the neck all along the back: neither
of these join with the tail, which is round at the tip, and composed of
about 22 feathers.

This fish is found in the river Orontes, and, I believe, also in some
stagnant waters near it. The markets of Aleppo are plentifully supplied
with it from the month of November till the beginning of March. The flesh
is red, like beef, of a rank taste; and though, for want of better, ate
much by the people, yet is esteemed unwholsome. The name it usually goes
by is _simack il aswad_, which signifies the black fish. Its proper name
however among the natives is _siloor_.

[433] The fish, Plate XII. fig. 2. has, upon a slight view, so much the
appearance of an eel, and, except its not being so fat, eats so like
that fish, that though it is much oftener brought to the tables of the
Europeans at Aleppo than any other fish found in the river Coic, it has
never been suspected of being any ways different from the common eel; and
yet, upon examination, it will be found of quite another genus.

The head is long and small: the extremity of the upper jaw runs out
to a narrow point, like the bill of a bird; on each side of which, a
little distant from the extreme point, are two tubuli, or processes. As
in the common eel there are two fins at the gills, from the occiput,
all along the ridge of the back, small prickles are placed at little
distances, resembling the teeth of a saw. These terminate at the origin
of a membranaceous fin, rising about four inches from the tail, and is
continued (as in the eel) along the lower part of the belly to the anus;
at which place are also found two or three prickles. The colour of the
head and back is blackish, variegated with dark yellow spots; the lower
belly white, changing gradually into a yellowish cast. The fin of the
lower belly, near to the anus, is yellow; the other half spotted with
black. The length of the fish described was eleven inches.

[434] The fish, Plate XIII. fig. 1. is about four inches long. The head
is large and flat, the body oblong and compressed. Its colour is mostly
of a dark silver. The eyes are large and protuberant. From the lower jaw
arise four cirri; the longer measure one inch, the shorter two-thirds of
an inch. From the upper jaw arise two longer, each measuring two inches
and a half, of a firmer texture than either those of the lower jaw, or of
two other small ones placed just by the nostrils. Between the two long
cirri are two small tubuli. The whole of the cirri are of a white colour,
excepting the two longest, which are of a darkish colour, like the upper
part of the head. The fins are eight in number; two by the gills, each
furnished with a strong saw-like bone: two small ones near the anus; one
of eight radii, situated half-way between the anus and the tail; one
consisting of seven radii on the back. Another fin, of a membraneous and
fleshy texture, arises from the middle of the back, and is continued all
along to the tail. The tail is forked.

[435] Plate XIII. fig. 2. represents a fish, which in its general form,
somewhat resembles the above. It is in length three inches: the head
is rather flatter: the mouth has a more inferior situation, and is in
proportion larger, than that of the former fish: eyes much smaller. The
cirri, situated as in the other, are eight in number, but much shorter,
these that rise from the upper jaw (being the longest) measuring only
one inch; they are also flatter at their origin. They both agree in the
number of their fins; neither has the saw-like bone in the fin of the
back, but only in those near the gills. The fleshy fin of the back is
much smaller than in the _zakzuk_, and rises at a much greater distance
from the backfin. The colour is a pale silver, marbled with grey,
particularly the lower part of the fins and tail; the two larger cirri
likewise marbled, the others white.

These two fishes, fig. 1. & 2. have no scales; and the palate, and other
structure of the inside of the mouth, is like that of the silurus.

This last described fish is also from the river Coic.

[436] This calculation was made by some priests from the harach, (a
pole-tax levied upon the male Christians and Jews, after they arrive at
a certain age that they are supposed to be capable of work): an estimate
of the bread consumed in the city, and the number of those who died
of the plague in 1742; which they found to be among the Christians in
the proportion of five to the hundred, and from thence they calculated
the Turks to be in the same proportion, and so reckoned the number at
300,000: but as all the Christians who can afford it keep out of the way
of infection, which but few Turks dare do, it is plain a much greater
proportion of the latter must die of the disease, and so cause a fallacy
in this calculation; so that I have only reckoned them at 200,000.

[437] Their menses begin from the age of twelve to fourteen, and continue
till forty, sometimes forty-five. In most they return once in four weeks,
and continue from three to seven days.

[438] See Plate XIV.

[439] This appears to be the same with what in India they call _bing_,
and is no other than the leaves of the female hemp, first powdered, then
put into wet pepper, and covered with hot ashes till it forms a sort of
paste, which they press into a thin cake, and then cut it into small
lozenges, and dry it. About half a drachm of this put into a pipe of
tobacco, or rather the nargeery, and smoked with the tobacco, will make a
person drunk, or rather mad; and a few grains, mixed with any thing sweet
(particularly, as they say, figs, though perhaps what it is swallowed in
is of little consequence), will, if taken inwardly, have the same effect.
They assert that acids will immediately put a stop to its effects. This
intoxicating quality of the hemp is mentioned by Galen.

[440] Composed of 720 drachms of quick-lime, and 90 drachms of orpiment
powdered. This they moisten a little at the time of using.

[441] _Jareed_ is a kind of javelin, or small stick, about two feet and
a half long, which they learn to throw very dextrously, so as to go
pointed as a dart. The exercise here meant is the throwing this when on
horseback, a mock-fight with this weapon being a common entertainment:
and it is surprising to see with what dexterity they manage their horses,
so as to avoid running one against another, when numbers are galloping
seemingly in the greatest disorder.

[454] Explanation of Plate XV. The windows are represented as opening on
the outer court-yards of a great house, where the colonade, or gallery,
and stair-case, are easily distinguished. In the front of the picture,
the Turkish method of decorating their rooms with Arab inscriptions,
painting and carving, is exhibited. The carpet, matrass, and cushions,
denote the divan properly furnished; in the nearest corner of which sits
a _kadee_, smoking the nargeery after the Persian manner. He is dressed
in what they call a _ferragee_, which is lined with fur, and has wide
sleeves. This dress, though most commonly worn by the lawyers, is also
sometimes wore by other persons of distinction: but the turbant is of
that sort which is peculiar to that profession. In the centre sits a
_sardar_, or aga of the Janizaries. The form of his turbant is that which
belongs to the officers of that body; but that of his robe is what is
wore indiscriminately by all well-dressed people, only peculiar to such
vests as are lined with short-haired furs, as sable, ermin, squirrel,
_&c._ which they wear in the spring and autumn. He is drinking coffee;
and before him stands a servant to receive the coffee-cup, in that dress,
and humble, submissive attitude in which they are accustomed to wait upon
their masters. In the farther corner sits a bashaw, smoking a pipe after
the manner of the Turks. His turbant is in the form that all the people
of fashion in that country wear, and his robe that which constitutes a
full dress in the winter; when it is lined with long-haired fur, such as
is taken from the ounce, foxes of different kinds, _&c._ The whole forms
a scene of a Turkish entertainment.

Plate XVI. represents a Turkish lady of condition in the proper dress of
Aleppo. She is represented as sitting carelessly on a divan, smoking a
pipe, and her servant presenting a dish of coffee in the usual manner.

[455] They have several methods of doing this; but the most common
composition is the following, _viz._ Take 120 drachms of sumach, and
boil it in 360 drachms of water, to the consumption of two-thirds of
the liquor. In this decoction, when strained, infuse the following
ingredients for some days; green vitriol, galls, allum, fresh branches of
walnut-tree, of each 5 drachms. With this the beard being first washed,
and well dried, is rubbed over, and the tincture suffered to remain on
about the space of an hour, after which they wash with warm water.

[456] The composition is as follows. Put 60 drachms of oil into an
earthen vessel on a gentle fire; and, when it begins to boil, throw in by
degrees 60 drachms of galls: cover the vessel with a smooth stone, and
let it remain on the fire till the galls become of a black, burnt colour.
It is then to be removed from the fire, and what is found sticking to the
cover being taken off, mixed with the finer part of what remains in the
vessel. To this must be added the following ingredients, finely powdered,
crude sal. ammoniac 20 drachms, æs. ust. 20 drachms, henna 120 drachms:
the whole, by kneading with the hands, is formed into little pieces or
tablets. It is applied with a little bit of wet stick.

[457] This is made of a mineral substance, called also _Ispahany_, from
the place it is brought from. It appears to be a rich lead-ore, and
is prepared by roasting it in a quince, apple, or trufle: then it is
levigated with oil of sweet almonds on a marble-stone. If intended to
strengthen the eyes, they often add flowers of olibanum or amber.

[458] The method of applying the henna is thus. They take some of the
henna in powder, and making it into a paste with water, roll or spin it
out into small threads; then they take a piece of leaven, and with a
rolling-pin roll it out into a very thin cake, which they cut out into
proper forms, for covering the hands, feet, fingers, and toes; and upon
this the threads of the henna-paste are placed in the forms they intend
to imprint upon the parts. A piece of the henna-paste is applied to the
tip of each finger and toe; and then the pieces of leaven-cake, prepared
as above, are tied on to the different parts they are intended for, and
suffered to remain there for two or three hours; at the expiration of
which all is taken off, and the mark of the several figures made with the
henna are found imprinted on the parts to which they were applied. They
then cover the whole hands and feet with a paste made of wheat-flour, a
small proportion of crude sal ammoniac, and a little quick-lime, with a
sufficient quantity of water, which in about half an hour turns all the
parts that had been before dyed of a dirty red or yellow, with the henna,
into a sort of black, or rather very dark green colour.

[459] Chinganas are a race of people, who are generally esteemed to be
the same with our Gypsies. They very much resemble Arabs, and, like them,
live under tents; but they are not acknowledged by them, or esteemed
orthodox Moslems. They are extremely poor, and some few are lodged
in tents round the skirts of the town all the year round, and hire
themselves for labourers, and other menial offices; but the greatest
number come thither in the spring from all parts, to assist in reaping
the corn.

[468] _Kennafy_ is a mixture of flour and water, made just thin enough to
run through the holes of a vessel they have on purpose, held over a hot
copper plate, which dries it quickly; so that it has the appearance of a
number of threads. This is mixed with butter and honey, and baked in the
oven.

[469] The fast of _Ramadan_ happens successively in every season of the
year: for as the Turks keep the lunar months, without any allowance, as
the Jews have, to make them correspond with the seasons, so they lose
about eleven days in every solar year; and by this means the month of
_Ramadan_ anticipates about that number of days every year. In other
affairs, that are requisite to fall at particular seasons, as farming
their duties on tobacco, _&c._ they observe the Greek months, which
correspond to the Julian calendar.

[470] _Sallah il Subh_, at day-break.

_Sallah il Dohr_, at noon.

_Sallah il Assr._ The common opinion is, that this praying-time is
mid-way between noon and sunset; but their true calculation, I have been
told, is as long after noon as half the distance of time between _Sallah
il Subh_ and _Sallah il Dohr_ amounts to.

_Sallah il Muggreb_, at sunset.

_Sallah il Ashie_, at an hour and a half after sunset.

[471] The Koran expressly says, that they shall have but four women,
whether wives or concubines (Sale’s Koran, ch. iv. p. 60.); and most
of the learned among them know this strictly to be their law: but what
I have mentioned above being the common practice, the far greater part
of the people believe it to be lawful. See Sale’s Koran, Preliminary
Discourse, § 6. p. 133.

[472] The tokens of virginity are expected by all sects in this country,
but more indecently exposed by the Turks than any other.

[473] _Sheih_ here signifies a saint, or holy man; but the name is also
applied to the head person in a village.

[474] _Hara_ is the general name given to the different divisions of the
city, which answers to our word _parish_.

[475] This service in English may be rendered thus. “O man, from the
earth thou wert at first created, and to the earth thou dost now return.
This grave being the first step in thy progress to the mansions of the
other world, if in thy actions thou hast been benevolent, thou art
absolved by God; but if, on the contrary, thou hast not been so, the
mercy of God is greater than all things. But remember what thou didst
believe in this world, That God is thy Lord, Mohammed thy Prophet, and in
all the Prophets and Apostles, and pardon is extensive.”

The Curds have a different service; which though it does not so much
regard the people of Aleppo, yet for its singularity I shall mention.

“If thou hast taken, thou shalt give: If thou hast done, thou shalt find:
If thou believest not, thou shalt see presently.”

[476] _Burgle_ is wheat boiled, then bruised by a mill, so as to take the
husk off, then dried, and kept for use. The usual way of dressing it is
either by boiling it like rice into a pilaw, or made into balls with meat
and spices; and, either fried or boiled, these balls are called _cubby_.

[477] The Greeks, Syrians, and Maronites, are kept upon the same
occasions, but differ as to the number of days. They are as follows:

                                              Greeks.  Syrians. Maronites.
  _Soom il Kebeer_, or Great Lent before
     Easter                                   48 days. 48 days. 48 days.
  _Soom il Rassle_, or Fast of the Apostles   12       12        4
  _Soom il Seida_, or Fast of the Holy Virgin 15       15       15
  _Soom il Milaad_, or Lent before Christmas  40       25       20

The Armenian Lents differ considerably from the others, and are

  _Soom il Ratas_                                          7 days.
  _Soom il Rasheishie_                                     7

  _Soom Kirkoor Saureech_                                  7
  _Soom il Seida_                                          7

  _Soom il Ajeeb il Saleeb_                                7
  _Soom Sarkees_                                           7
  _Soom Mar Jacob_                                         7

  _Soom Marè Hannah il Chinkaly_, which is a voluntary
    fast, and all not obliged to keep it                  48

Besides these Lents, all the native Christians keep fast Wednesdays and
Fridays (one or two excepted), through the whole year.

[478]

same name), who walks before the consul with a staff tipp’d with silver.
He is also employed as a messenger, and takes care of all letters.

and many of the natives of the Romish faith (when not prohibited by the
bashaw) frequent.

  One of _Capuchins_.  } Each has only two or three friars.
  One of _Carmelites_. }

The _Jesuits College_ seldom has more than two or three.

[484] This is attributed to the dews, which fall in small quantities
during the nights at that season, and which the natives who sleep abroad
have nothing to shelter them from; and as the Europeans, who usually
sleep on bedsteads, are exempted from this complaint, and, by lying
abroad without this conveniency, have been seized with the ophthalmia,
this conjecture seems to have some foundation in experience.

[487] On the 16th of this month, the thermometer was unfortunately broke,
and it was the beginning of September before another could be procured.

[488] The thermometer now used was a small portable one.

[489] A town in the gulf of Scanderoon, the chief port in that part of
the country for landing goods from Egypt; the inhabitants of which have a
good deal of commerce with the Curds, who dwell on these mountains.

[490] See the method in the chapter on the plague.

[491] From what I have since seen of the manners of the people, I have
reason to believe that those symptoms were often concealed.

[492] A high part of the suburbs to the north-east.

[493] In a letter written, at Aleppo in the year 1719, by an English
gentleman who had then been about thirty years in that country, the
author says, that, since he had been there, the plague had never visited
them oftener than once in ten or twelve years. Those within the memory
of the people were in 1719, 1729, 1733, and the late one, which ended in
the year 1744; since which time ten years are now elapsed without any
appearance of it, either here or upon the coast of Syria.

[494] Some have told me, that the plague of 1719 came from the northward;
but none of the journals or letters I have perused make any mention of
this circumstance; though all of them confirm its raging at Tripoli,
Sidon, _&c._ some months before it appeared at Aleppo.

In the year 1728 the plague made great havock in Egypt, and in the summer
of that year it raged at Byass, and the parts adjacent; but did not break
out at Aleppo till the year 1729.

At Tripoly, Sidon, and Damascus, the plague raged in the year 1732. It
was 1733 before it raged at Aleppo.

For the progress of the last plague, see p. 191. concerning its coming to
Aleppo; from thence it went to Damascus, and the coast of Syria, where
its greatest force was exerted in the year 1744; at which time it was
greatly abated at Aleppo.

[495] In the year 1719, the plague made great havock, and advanced so
fast in the spring, that the Europeans shut up about the middle of March,
and opened about the middle of July.

In 1729 the number of the sick being few, it was the middle of May before
any shut up, and they were not above a month confined.

In 1733 the disease raged with violence, though not quite so much as in
1719. The Europeans, however, shut up, and got abroad again at the same
seasons as in the former year.

In 1742 they were confined much about the same time as in 1729.

In 1743 the distemper raged with violence, though not quite to that
degree as in 1733. The Europeans shut up the 11th of April, and opened
about the middle of July.

In 1744 the number of the sick being inconsiderable, and the terror from
the distemper much abated by being used to it, few of the Europeans shut
up. The progress of the disease was just as above mentioned.

[497] Curds, or, as the English commonly call them, _Gourdeens_, are a
race of hardy, robust people, who inhabit most of the mountains Amanus,
and live chiefly by plunder, making excursions for this purpose into the
neighbouring plains, and retiring to the mountains again whenever any
force is sent against them.

[498] It is lawful for them to abstain from going into an infected city,
but not to fly from one infected while they are in it.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up

and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
